<p>What she did know was that her people, the ones who had served her father until not long ago, were dying. In droves. Heaps. She’d been to the medical bays and seen them---against the wishes of her parents, of course. They were ripped asunder, their bodies wrecked, torn, as though they’d been blown apart with violent magic or sundered by the jaws of the fearsome abominations that dwelt in the Abyssal Forests below The Grand Imperial Fleet.</p>
<p>She could not bear the thought of the carnage. Even safe in her own cage-like workshop, where she was protected and comfortable amidst her tools and machines, her vision swam with the gruesome images of the dead soldiers. She wiped the sweat from her brow, and opened her eyes wide, for whenever she closed them, the red images returned.</p>
<p>She focused her attention once again, gulping back her terror and sadness and hesitation. Her hand fumbled for her pen for a moment and the notes she made in the massive tome were very nearly illegible for all her shaking. She let out a tiny growl of frustration, trying to form the letters properly so that she’d be able to read her formulae and design notes later. Focusing so much on the words, she found, was distracting her from their meaning.</p>
<p>She sat back and looked over her shoulder at the corkboard where half-a-dozen of her preliminary sketches were tacked up haphazardly. They depicted a new spellgun firing mechanism, one that should fix the problems the soldiers were having with their current armaments. It wasn’t a project that her mother, a Duchess, would have wanted her taking on, but she hadn’t told anyone of her plans, so there was no use worrying about being reprimanded. People were dying, and she knew she could help.</p>
<p>She was half done with the project already, but every hour, every second that she wasted fretting over the images of the medical bay was another that men would die in the Ground War. All she needed to do was find a way to integrate her new firing mechanism into the receiver of the spellgun without disrupting the delicate ejection system. Putting the charging cell too close to the cartridge rim would make the mechanism prone to jamming, negating any potential benefit, but the further the charging cell was from the cartridge, the more field resistance would lower the effective output of the cell. It was a fairly typical arcanics problem, one that Fleurette would have found only a little challenging under normal conditions, but she was finding herself increasingly distracted, despite her best efforts.</p>
<p>Fleurette pushed her chair back, snatched her sketchbook from the desk, and stood before the corkboard, resolving to simplify matters by drawing out any useful solution that came into her head. In a few minutes, she’d come up with five different approaches, each with merits and flaws. Contrary to how she’d felt earlier, she was starting to think that it would in fact be easier to design a new ejector to work with her firing mechanism than it would be to try to co-opt the old design. That eliminated three of the five plausible sketches. She posted the remaining two on the board and set to work refining them.</p>
<p>Five hours of intense concentration later, she belatedly realized that it was well past dinner time. Years ago, before the War, her mother would have dragged her from her room to make sure she ate. Now, it was somewhat rare for anyone to visit her here in the workshop, even her parents. They were both busy with their own work, leaving her to come and go as she pleased.</p>
<p>Five hours had been all she’d needed. She held up the two new weapons, freshly carved from brassy magesteel feedstock on her very own cutting machine. They were rough, and she’d have to polish and heat-treat them both, but they were functional. She’d been unable to decide which method would yield the best results, so she’d gone ahead and built prototypes for both.</p>
<p>Fleurette, being the thirteen-year-old daughter of a craftsman, did not own a firing-box for testing spellguns. With a frown, she hastily constructed one with tack-welded sheets of spare brass and put a leather apron inside it as a target. She punched the leads of an expensive curonometer through the leather and set the device outside the box.</p>
<p>Hefting the first of the two new spellguns, she loaded it with a single three-Lirex spell cartridge, pleased that it slid into place effortlessly. She cocked the weapon, aimed into the box, and pulled the trigger. The weapon barked in the confined space of the workshop, leaving a arcane ring resounding in the air over the plink of the ejected cartridge. She checked the curonomitor, which read nine-hundred and seventy curons of mana, nearly the full amount of energy contained in the cartridge she’d loaded. She jumped up and down, clapping her hands. Modern spellguns only output five to six hundred curons with the same shell; her design had worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>After checking the second weapon (which came in at nine hundred and sixty-three curons, just a little less efficient) she set both prototypes aside in a fine wooden box and finished up a report on the new firing and ejection systems. In the report, she called the test devices Rosethorn and Lotus. Within a month, new spellrifles were designed, built, and distributed across the entire Grand Imperial Fleet.</p>
<p>In honor of the success of her inventions, she finally named her tiny workshop, calling it, of course, Rosthorn &amp; Lotus.

<p>In honor of the success of her inventions, she finally named her tiny workshop, calling it, of course, Rosthorn &amp; Lotus. The Ground War ended that very month.The Lightning Sea was a vast plain of clouds several kilometers above the ground. Scattered cirrus covered it from above. The eponymous lightning skittered across the interior of the clouds like the legs of a spider, occasionally leaping up and skyward before crashing back into the clouds. Tempests swarmed in the sea, brewing like the angry eyes of a misty god looking for victims to electrify.</p>
<p>The Sea constantly buzzed with flying monstrosities. Huge, veiny-winged, corpulent abominations flocked back and forth through the treacherous sky-scape, sporadically vaporized in gaseous puffs that emitted a wretched odor for kilometers. Even those fliers, with four-meter wingspans and razor talons, were merely gnats to the antediluvian titans that walked the primordial forests on the surface.</p>
<p>Everything about the surface was monstrous and wild. The ancient lore spoke of a northern land where the animals of the surface were the same as the ones aboard the ship, but the Abyss below the Lightning Sea held only grotesque, colossal mockeries of their kin. Analogs of potted plants grew twice as tall as a man on the surface. Insects smaller than a fingernail were big enough to serve as makeshift armor. Titans frequently trundled through the roost of avians, dislodging great swarms that blackened the sky with their scaly bodies.</p>
<p>Of the great beasts of the surface, these hulking golems were the most feared. They were not the most powerful of entities that resided in the Abyss, but their hostile, aggressive behavior made them more dangerous than any other. The mountainous landscape of Wolbara provided too many places for the titans to attack from. For millennia, the only settlements on the continent itself had been built into the very bedrock, where the giants could not reach.</p>
<p>To survive this predatory landscape, the second wave of settlers had come aboard great aerial ships, and for a thousand years, they had stayed there.If a human were to find themselves in the Abyss, that hellish patch of surface below the Swath, alive and able to look up at the sky, there was a small chance they might spot several glittering shapes in the morning sky. If said hypothetical person was so equipped and inclined, they might take out a handy spyglass for better viewing. With such an instrument, one might be able to catch a glimpse of each of the humongous ships through the massive foliage above. There would have been about a dozen such vessels, scattered as wide as the sky. A few would have glinted darkly, like polished coal. Others would have appeared colorless like chrome or diamonds. The remainder would have reflected a brassy, golden tinge. These daytime stars were the ships of the Grand Imperial Fleet.</p>
<p>Restless, the ships might even appear to be moving. With a strong enough telescope, one might be able to pick out smaller ships ferrying cargo to and from the larger vessels. This would have been easiest as the ships passed overhead, but it would have been unlikely that a human observer could have survived long enough to see the sight.</p>
<p>The Fleet maintained a constant, nervous lap around the inner edge of the Swath. It traveled slowly, conserving energy for when it was most needed. Despite the vast distances involved, the gargants of the Abyss were drawn to the immense magical power of the reactors of the Fleet ships. The soaring, alpine topography of Wolbara and the restrictions of flight technology made navigation a nightmare. Without careful observation and piloting, the ships would become easy prey for the mountaintop titans. Though such encounters were rare, every one was devastating. Past confrontations had cut the number of major ships in the Grand Imperial Fleet from more than twenty-five to eleven in just under a ten centuries; an unacceptable loss rate to a fleet of limited numbers.</p>
<p>The ships of the Fleet did everything in their power to avoid fighting. They wove a snaking path across the maze of the continent, flying as high as their engines would take them and as far from the mountaintops as they could navigate. When confronted by one of the giants, they preferred to flee than to fight. Fighting the swarms of flying monsters was one thing, but no warrior or mage or gunship or cruiser had ever slain a gargant in combat.As the trailing edge of the Fleet passed over a particularly violent storm, those flying monsters laid siege to a rearward ship. They sought the precious meat readily available on the decks, the poor and unfortunate soldiers unlucky enough to be caught on duty at the time of the attack. This time, the fliers were multi-winged and many-clawed creatures called “pickers.” These aerial vermin attacked the ships of the Fleet, heedless of the danger. They swarmed around the blazing spellguns, taking rifle-fire bare-breasted to snatch men off the combat decks.</p>
<p>If left to their own devices, the bird-creatures would begin to peel open the armor of the ship and snatch people from inside, as often happened in the old days. On the decks of the ship the men gathered, pouring from the barracks and the gunnery stations to defend the ship.</p>
<p>The soldiers stamped across the narrow combat decks, clipping themselves to safety rails and readying their weapons. They knew that firing at random was hopeless; every shot counted in the swirling nightmare, and the infantry spellrifles were too short-ranged to hit the pickers away from the ship. So the infantry counted the minutes as the wave grew, preparing to pummel down on them. They took steady aim and hunkered down. The call went out for the deck guns, and the infantry struggled to stay upright as the massive, thirty-centimeter spellgun turrets on the starboard side of the ship erupted just in time to break the wave of wings and claws before it descended on the crewmen. It was in that confusion that the infantry opened fire, firing wildly at the eyes, groins, and wing-pits of the fliers. The magic enhancements provided by the support staff of the ship seemed to do well that day, and the infantry managed to thin the swarm considerably before the next wave coalesced.</p>
<p>Partially hidden in turret sockets, the deck guns began recharging. They fired in sequence as much as possible, but concerted effort was required to prevent massive casualties to the infantry squads. As the center portion warmed back up, the crews pulled spent casings and scrolls from the smoking chambers of the cannons and the fore and aft section guns opened up a steady barrage intended to disrupt the fliers ability to flock cohesively. The guns cracked through the foggy air, deafening the crew and repairmen near the guns and everyone else in the void between the outer armor and inner hull of the great ship. The blue-white arcs surrounded in circular containment runes seared through the crush, boiling the monsters by the dozen with a resonating knell. These bells of war tolled infrequently and this was their only flaw. Deck guns performed well at attacking the swarms head on, where the powerful blasts seared through many beasts with each shot, but they could not target individual fliers quickly enough to be effective against diffuse clouds.</p>
<p>From small gaps in the organically carved and overwrought armor the shafts of small rockets sprouted. The rockets used seeking magic to guide their lethal payloads to individual animals, so they were deployed only when the horde was dispersed. Easily mass-produced by the spellworks of the ship, the rockets were the best weapon for clearing the sky of stragglers. As the swarm spread out over the hull, the armor of the ship burst forth with intercepting schools of rockets. The volley arced out of the ship’s armor, streaking towards individually chosen targets with deadly accuracy. As the rockets impacted, a tentative cheer emanated from the interior decks of the ship. The battle appeared to be going well.</p>
<p>The rocket crews fired another volley, pushing the pickers back into a flapping swarm just in time for the gunships to arrive. The civilians watching from magical viewing screens deep inside the ship applauded again, this time with more vigor.</p>
<p>These cruisers were small, light, fast strike ships, ten to twenty meters long and they had their own gunnery crews. Maneuverable enough to chase the droves of monsters and armed with rapid-fire spellguns, they could disperse fliers with relative ease. Their arrival from the fore of the Fleet was a welcome relief to the combatants and the civilians alike. It meant that fewer men would need to die that day. They darted across the back of the swarm, ripping through it with their weapons, and arced skyward to dive down through the middle from above. It wasn’t just a popular tactic against the avian menace, it had become their signature maneuver.</p>
<p>To the dismay of the crew, a second flock of pickers hammered into the port flank of the ship even as the cruisers blazed a hole through the center of the swarm. In the blink of an eye, a dozen men were taken overboard and chewed to pieces as they fell. The new swarm played to the weaknesses in the ship’s defenses, boiling aside from spellgun fire and spreading wide through the bloody sky. The starboard swarm expanded as well, as though they had learned from the second.</p>
<p>At the order of the Captain, the cruisers split a detachment off to strike at the port side swarm. They swung around the top and bottom of the ship, just missing the glassed-in observation deck, and caught a portion of the flock in their crossfire. The starboard swarm retreated a distance from the deck guns to engage the remaining cruisers with vicious effect. Given enough time, their claws could rip the smaller ships to pieces. By hiding amongst the melee of cruisers the pickers were effectively safe from the deck guns. What should have been a relatively bloodless battle had turned into a slaughter.The captain of a transport ship sat at a bar on one of the lower decks, watching a public viewing screen as the battle unfolded. The people crushed in around him, desperate to see progress. They hushed at every announcement. Despite the success of the rocket crews, the air was tense.</p>
<p>There were only a few stray men in the tavern. The rest were the wives and sisters and daughters of the soldiers out on the decks, many still in their work clothes. There was only so much room in the spellworks and the factories, but most of the women in the bar were ready to rush away at a moment’s notice to assist the war effort.</p>
<p>In a past life, the captain might have made a pass at one or two of them, but that was a past he had left behind him. He sat among the standing crowd, eyeing the screen, not speaking to anyone as they clenched their fists and waited in disquiet for the next bit of terrible news.</p>
<p>A work foreman burst in, causing half the crowd to shout and raise their hands in a sort of bidding war.</p>
<p>“I’ve only got five spots!” he shouted tersely. “Two charging specialists, two shell machine operators, and one scribe. Now!”</p>
<p>With that, the foreman left, knocking the door wide. The women’s shouting began again as they tried to sort themselves out.</p>
<p>“I’m scribe, and I’ll take Eoma, Vun, Dael, and Serne,” one shouted, using her upraised arms to direct the group. She led the way outside, taking off at a run to catch up to the foreman. As the other four charged into the street, the bar became hushed again.</p>
<p>They waited again, looking on as pickers stole their men. Several women burst into tears as the viewing screen showed a squad being taken from the side decks. The captain watched in morose despondence.</p>
<p>The screen shifted between points of view again, showing the top deck. In the distance, the cruisers appeared, drawing a cheer from the entire bar. The captain rose on his feet as his fists clenched reflexively. Years ago, when he was young and audacious, he might have been out there with them. “You’re going to be okay,” one of the older soldiers told the recruit. He was fresh off the Duke, and the other members of his new squad were gathered around him, trying to make sure he was ready for war.</p>
<p>“I know,” he said, bluffing. He wasn’t a coward, but the sounds of battle echoed like thunder just outside the sortie compartment. He knew what he was getting into. He knew too well. His older brother had been attacked by a picker, and he was now a disabled veteran.</p>
<p>“Kralmox, you ready?” shouted his commanding officer.</p>
<p>The recruit called out, but his answer was drowned out by another outburst of deck gun fire. Instead, he saluted.</p>
<p>“We’re midship, top deck today, boys. Try not to get lost!” the lieutenant shouted. The double meaning of his words made even the most stern members of the squad pale. “On the ready line, marines!”</p>
<p>The squad shifted into a crouch on a painted line that led through the compartment and up the stairs. Through the hatch, the recruit visualized, the line would go up another flight and pass through the outer armor of the Dragoon. On the upper surface of the ship, it would guide them to a post roughly centered between their compartment and the rear observation dome.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, it’s been my pleasure,” the lieutenant said, turning to open the hatch. “Charge!”</p>
<p>Recruit Kralmox was at the end of the line, so he watched as the squad moved up and out of the protection of the sortie compartment. They tramped up the stairs, boots clanking on the grating, and up into the blinding light of the morning sky.</p>
<p>Hordes of giant monsters bore down on the ship. The squad swept their weapons across the sky, covering each other as they moved from deck plate to deck plate. The surface was uneven with thick armor, so the soldiers knelt in the depressions for cover. The recruit almost forgot to close the hatch, so he ducked back down into the outer stair and pulled it closed. When he came back up, his squad was already ahead of him, moving quickly aft and shooting their way through a few pickers as they passed.</p>
<p>Recruit Kralmox took a deep breath and sprinted back towards them, skidding to a stop behind the bulk of the squad.</p>
<p>“I thought you chickened out,” said the soldier he landed next to.</p>
<p>“Sorry, left the oven on,” he said, his smooth face drawn with terrified excitement.</p>
<p>The lieutenant made a fire sign at a cluster of pickers that stood between them and their post. Being the last man in the line, Kralmox scrambled out to form the farthest left edge of their triangle. He opened fire perfectly in time with the others, aiming for the sockets of the wing joints. His spellgun barked and his shots punched through the fleshy fabric of the wing. His target fell as the rest of the squad dropped the other members of the cluster.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, the lieutenant led them over the bodies and further towards the rear observation dome.</p>
<p>“Nice shooting,” called his movement partner.</p>
<p>The recruit almost answered, but the squad arrived at the deck emplacement. He gulped back his response. The emplacement was little more than an open crater in the armor, with a lip almost high enough for them to crouch behind. It had no top, so the marines could fire up at monsters above.</p>
<p>“Sir!” the recruit shouted, “Above starboard!”</p>
<p>The lieutenant’s eyes went wide as a truly massive swarm bore down on them from the sky. “OUT!” he shouted.</p>
<p>The squad dove from the walls of the emplacement just as the swarm sawed its way through the barricades. The men rolled onto their backs and fired, trying to disperse the monsters.</p>
<p>Once the swarm was gone, the lieutenant counted heads. They were missing a few. Recruit Kralmox was as pale as snow.</p>
<p>The lieutenant’s eyes cast about wildly for some kind of advantage.</p>
<p>“Alright, aft! Towards the dome!” he said, throwing his arm that direction.In the midst of the carnage aboard the ship, in that very observation deck at the top aft of the Clockwork Dragoon, Embless Fleurette Mecanwaithe watched the battle unfold. She sat at a brass tea table with a porcelain top painted in the ancient style, with depictions of tiny versions of modern ground flora and fauna. It had been three years since she first hung up her sign and opened Rosethorn &amp; Lotus for business, but they had been three hard, tireless years.</p>
<p>She daintily lifted her tea saucer up as the gunships thundered overhead, rattling the table across the deck. The tea remained remarkably steady in her hand, and not a drop fell to her silken skirts or her red bodice. She merely tracked the arcs across the sky with her eyes, distant but alert. With excellent posture, she turned to the starboard as the fliers engaged the cruisers. She shook her head in saddened frustration as one of the expensive craft and its irreplaceable crew met a sparkling, explosive end.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, pressing her slender, deft fingers against the bridge of her nose. Don’t give up, she willed them.</p>
<p>Part of her deeply wanted to protect the men fighting for the safety of the ship. She wanted to build armor and weapons and shields and engines for them, whatever protections they needed. She owed them so much for their bravery, and she quietly feared that she would never be able to earn their respect. The other part of her, the part that she kept hidden even from herself, agreed about joining the battle, but not for altruistic reasons. The other part of her was thrilled by the scene of carnage, and wanted nothing more than to risk her own life alongside the deck infantry, unleashing all her cunning and strength and power. That part reigned only in secret, when the corset of society became too tight and when she couldn’t stand to bend to the rules anymore. She locked that terrible part of her psyche away again, returning to her tea.</p>
<p>As the battle raged on, the bodies of dead fliers spattered across the thick glass of the observation dome, causing warding runes to reverberate loudly into existence and obscure the girl’s view of the scene. Occasionally a man’s body would sail out over the top of the ship, having been torn from the cockpit of a cruiser or from behind one of the barricades. She drank the scene in, appearing perfectly, immaculately calm. Inside, she seethed with anger and sadness.</p>
<p>“He’s making a fine mess of it, isn’t he,” she said to no one. “I wonder, how will the Captain rationalize his failure this time?”The remaining pickers were thrilled at their bloody feast. The top surface of the Dragoon was a prime location for them to land to try to snatch soldiers away to be eaten. They slammed down out of the sky, diving between bursts of deck gun fire to pluck away the men on the upper decks. The infantry dove behind barricades built into the sharp, undulating armor plates, desperately avoiding death while doing a heroic job of fighting back. Fleurette did not avert her eyes.</p>
<p>A shredded squadron of marines backed right up to the wall of the observation dome, hoping to put something behind them as a means of defense. They didn’t notice the lone occupant of the dome, watching them over her tea. She gazed at their backs, willing them to return safe, knowing that many would not. She looked up just in time to see a cluster of three pickers swoop over the dome from the aft of the ship, right down onto the squadron of infantry. They pounced, embedding their arm-long scythe-like talons in the backs, necks, and heads of the soldiers. The survivors struggled forward to gain a little ground and opened fire at point blank range. From there, the kills were a little easier. The pickers could only flail clumsily as they stood on their hooked feet, giving the marines a slight edge.</p>
<p>Some of the missed shots caromed off the dome. The ones that connected sprayed gouts of blood across the glass. Inside, Fleurette shifted a little in her seat to peer between warding runes and splatters to better see the mayhem. A lump rose in her throat, a mix of anxiety and frustration and excitement. Taking a breath, she sipped her tea and quelled her desires. They were unseemly, vulgar wants; as a lady of the Fleet, she could not let herself be tainted by such thoughts. She was the embless of her House, and it was her duty to be the epitome of the Dragoon’s ideals. She took several deep breaths and tried to detach herself from the gruesome scene.The sick bay was awash with gore. Wounded soldiers struggled in agony as the doctors and healers did their best to salvage what they could. Even the professionals, the surgeons and priests, blanched at the appalling damage done to their men. They seemed unprepared, as though they’d grown soft in the past few years.</p>
<p>“Healer, please! Bed nine needs your attention! The surgeon said he can’t save him!” the nurse said, tugging on the sleeve of one of the shocked physicians. After a moment, he snapped out of it and returned to his duties. The nurse gulped back waves of nausea and made her way across the slippery floor.</p>
<p>She knelt next to a soldier whose arm had been taken, assessing the damage. He was screaming in agony, but he calmed down a little bit when she laid her hand on his head.</p>
<p>“You’re going to be fine. My name is Cybeline, what’s yours?” she cooed, doing her best to soothe him so she could examine his wound. It was bad. Pickers usually sliced right through flesh and bone, but this man had been carried for a distance. His humerus jutted out of a ragged, bloody stump. Trying not to panic, the nurse pawed through her kit, finding a bandage and a small blue potion. She poured the potion over the wound and wrapped it immediately. The man’s screams subsided as her fingers nimbly knit a bundle around his wrecked limb. The sick bay was so loud with screams and activity that she couldn’t even hear the potion’s sizzle. She had no idea how well it had worked, but she had to move on.</p>
<p>Another stretcher was brought in. The surgeons and healers were too busy to investigate each case, so assessing each new patient fell to the nurses. All the others were busy, so a young nurse named Cybeline made her way over, stepping between limbs and equipment and refuse.</p>
<p>The medics who had brought him down were weeping. One laid his hand on the head of the patient and tugged the bloodstained sheet up his chest. The nurse immediately saw that the man was nearly dead. She could tell that one of the medics knew him, so she dismissed the medics back to their duties so the man wouldn’t have to watch his friend die.</p>
<p>She carefully pulled back the cover, readying herself for the horror. The man was nearly severed in half. A picker claw was embedded in his lower ribs and had passed through most of his torso. She sniffed back her own sob, observing the extent of the damage.</p>
<p>“Code One!” she cried. “I need a senior healer!”</p>
<p>Moments later, a healer appeared next to her. He patted her on the back in momentary comfort, then knelt to examine the patient. When he looked back up, he shook his head.Some of the living fliers had started to eat the fallen soldiers right there on the deck of the Dragoon. Others took to the skies with their mauled prizes. The remainder continued their battle with the soldiers, rushing towards them and flapping their wings to confound their fire.</p>
<p>As the girl watched, one of the marines slammed directly against the glass of the dome. The monster clawed ferociously at him but he had managed to trap his rifle in its claws. He had narrowly preventing it from slicing him to ribbons, but his gun was crushing his ribcage against the observation dome. The brave soldier drew his boarding sword and made slashing strokes at the picker’s beak and face to keep it from biting his head off. The strikes only distracted the beast, however, and in retribution it began slamming his spellgun against him. He was being beaten to death with his own firearm. The man, flailing and gasping against the glass finally saw the girl inside, and desperately motioned for her to fetch help.</p>
<p>Painfully aware of the restrictions and responsibilities of her family, she could not join in the battle. Instead of dashing off gracelessly, she calmly set down her tea, walked a few steps to the center of the room, took a small spellgun from a holster hidden at the small of her back behind her luxurious golden hair, and leveled it at the beast on the other side of the glass. She chanted a brief incantation and inscribed a rune with the gun barrel in the air before her. The rune reflected against the glass, drawing a cylinder through it. She waited as the beast raised its head to strike again and fired, precisely as its eye passed through the center of the cylindrical volume projected by the rune. The spellgun barked harshly inside the dome, a sharp piercing snap followed by the typical tuning-fork ring of magic. The bolt of red energy lanced between the runes, exiting the dome without harming it, and struck the creature in the back of the skull through the right eyeball. It jerked spastically, falling back with the soldier’s weapon.</p>
<p>The man, dazed and confused as to how he survived the encounter, turned to look inside the dome. He wiped away some of the gore with his fist, and peered in at the girl, who lifted her teacup in a salute to him. He blinked a few times before noticing her appearance, and promptly saluted her back. His wrist was rotated in the old way, signifying his gratitude to her House specifically. Turning, he wrested his demolished ruin of a weapon from the talons of the killed picker, and rushed back into the fray to help his comrades.</p>
<p>The girl returned to her seat, replacing the spent spell cartridge in the magazine of the tiny gun. Three years ago, she had engraved the elegant device with the name “Lotus.” She suppressed an involuntary tremble of agitation as she ran her fingertips over the inscription, jaw clenched slightly.The Second Deck Lieutenant, who had been watching the battle at the observation deck from time to time, finally decided that the casualties were getting too heavy up top. He reported to the Upper Deck Commander his losses, who grimly marked them off a slate with a grease pencil. The Commander turned to his communications officer on the other side of the armored command pit and bade him relay the news to the Bridge.</p>
<p>The Deck Infantry Strategist received the information a few moments later through several communication officers who filtered the important message from the wartime babble and terrified screaming. He confirmed the losses with the other strategists and marked them off the floating map of the ship. More and more areas were turning orange and red with losses as the other strategists filled in their new reports.</p>
<p>The Captain watched this all with growing frustration. The man standing at his side watched with impassive eyes and glittering but useless decorations, waiting for the Captain to speak.</p>
<p>Eventually, as the losses passed a hundred men, he did. “This is the worst it’s been in a long time, isn’t it, Arnos.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my Lord. We haven’t suffered losses like this since the Ground War.”</p>
<p>The Captain didn’t notice the slight. The implication had been that these situations were handled better in the years before the House fell.</p>
<p>“Is the situation recoverable before reinforcements from Old Wither arrive?” the Captain asked, rubbing his temple in restrained agitation.</p>
<p>“It is, Captain Ra-Nydor,” the man replied, again impassive. The Captain would never notice, but inside Arnos was seething at the appalling losses.</p>
<p>“How do you figure?”</p>
<p>The man’s eyes moved. They flicked to the Captain, gauging his cooperation. He saw no chance that the Captain would give him command of anything, but there was another card he could play.</p>
<p>“Shall we see what the Embless can make of the situation, my Lord?” he said.</p>
<p>“I know she’s spent a fair amount time ridding engineering of parasites, but what good will your little girl be in a real combat situation? In the middle of a war like this?”</p>
<p>“I am your advisor, Captain. I advise you remember her talents with the ship’s systems, that is all.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t change the fact that the Embless’s only combat experience is below decks hunting spare elementals.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, she is the most qualified to salvage the ship from this…” catastrophe, he thought, “…event.”</p>
<p>The captain glared at the advisor in open suspicion for a moment. To him, this was a clear ploy to bring much-needed favor to a disgraced, nepotistic family. Unfortunately, it was a gamble he needed to make.</p>
<p>“So be it, Arnos. Show me what House Mecanwaithe can do.”</p>
<p>Advisor Councilman Arnos Mecanwaithe turned to a younger man going over strategy at the map.</p>
<p>“Graf Kitharon, would you please see if you can fetch the Embless?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, Councilman,” replied the Graf, who despite outranking Arnos was quite pleased to go on such an errand. Lombard Kitharon quit the bridge with the intensity of a man interested in a woman.He made his way rapidly down the ornately decorated main spinal corridor towards the center of the ship, ignoring the wondrous portraits and skyscapes that hung from the fabulous walls. He took the most direct path, clearing civilians out of his way with his mere presence. He strode (rather than ran) exuding confidence and control, but inside he wanted to rush to the Embless and declare how much they need her. He chided himself for such childish and uncivilized thoughts. He passed through the corridor gate to the main hexadome, through it, and into the section of the ship that housed the upper classes, known as the Crust. He strode to the young woman’s home, House Mecanwaithe, but was promptly informed by the humble servants that she was absent, and they knew not where.</p>
<p>Silently cursing himself for not having foreseen the Embless’s behavior, the Graf called in to the bridge at a nearby radio terminal to inform the Captain and his Advisor of the delay. He then set off for the aft of the ship, exiting the Crust proper and returning to the labyrinthine corridors. Several bulkheads later, he rose up to the level of the underlayer of hull armor by way of the locked off combat level stairs. He barely even needed to flash his insignia before the guards let him through.</p>
<p>“Is she up there?” he asked in passing.</p>
<p>“Sir. The Embless is in the Observation Deck, if that’s who you mean sir.”</p>
<p>He didn’t bother to reply, and instead strode up the stairs, aware of the time his trip had taken. He stepped lightly up the ornate spiral staircase, spotting her at the lone table, taking her tea.</p>
<p>“I should have known,” he said out loud, slightly winded from the climb.</p>
<p>Unsurprised in the least, she replied, “Known what, Lombard? Where I would be while we are at war?”</p>
<p>“You always have Darjeeling when you’re nervous,” he said, smiling at her. He held her eyes just long enough to make her blush.</p>
<p>To hide her color, she asked, “So I assume they’ve requested my presence on the bridge?”</p>
<p>“They have. Please come with me to the Bridge, Embless Mecanwaithe.”</p>
<p>“But whatever for?” she asked, too innocently, and already following towards the stairs.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you know, Embl—”</p>
<p>“I swear that if you call me by my title one more time, Lombard, I’ll cancel all our appointments until you’re crowned prince of the Empire,” she interrupted, exaggerating.</p>
<p>“You started it,” he interjected, playfully.</p>
<p>But she didn’t share his levity.</p>
<p>“Please, lets hurry. Our troops are in trouble.”“They need you.”</p>
<p>“I know. I just wish that there were some precedent for this.”</p>
<p>“You want a precedent for the Embless of a fallen House to assist the recently instated Captain of an ancient airship with his tactical and technical inadequacies? I’d dare say that’s unlikely.”</p>
<p>Their footsteps tapped pronouncedly across the Crust on their way to the Bridge, audible even over the omnipresent city-sound and even the echoing chaos outside the hull.</p>
<p>“You know what I mean. I’ll go save the Captain’s skin, but in exchange all he’ll give me is more loathing and condescension. It’s not exactly going to be a fair trade.”</p>
<p>“But you’re doing this for the troops, not the Captain,” Lombard struggled.</p>
<p>“Yes, but by helping my people, I expose the weakness in our new leaders,” she said, drawing herself up slightly, as though a breeze had blown through her protective overcoat. “You know the Captain. He doesn’t take kindly to criticism.”</p>
<p>“Surely he’ll listen to you, though!”</p>
<p>“He has no choice. He doesn’t have any other options. That doesn’t mean he’ll like it.”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay. Lets just hurry.”</p>
<p>They glided down up the stairs to the Corridor Gate as quickly as social convention allowed. It was one thing to be in a hurry, but it was something else completely for those of the noble or military class to act improperly. Such things were dishonorable, even in wartime.They swept through the Spinal Corridor, stopping at the suggestion of the Councilman to check in on the sub-armor combat crews along the spine of the ship. Many were struggling to keep up with supplying their deck guns with fresh spell canisters from the conveyors. Some were working to repair damaged power couplings, and others still frantically tried to get their conveyors back into working order.</p>
<p>With every problem they witnessed, the concern gnawing at Fleurette grew. She kept her emotions in check, never letting more than the slightest downturn of her lips change her expression. But the clever Graf was attuned to her feelings and it wasn’t long before, he noticed something was bothering her.</p>
<p>“Fleurette, stop for a second,” he said, catching her sleeve gently before she sped away again.</p>
<p>“What is it Lombard?” she asked, turning impatiently. Beneath the imperious mask he thought he saw a mixture of anxiety and desperation on her face.</p>
<p>“Look, I know you’re nervous, but this isn’t the time to stall. They’ve all got jobs to do. Let’s stop bothering them and get up to the Bridge before more guns start failing. If they can’t keep those guns working, the people outside die. And if the marines don’t survive, eventually the pickers will find a way in and all the people on the—”</p>
<p>“Don’t misunderstand my state, Graf Kitharon. I’m not stalling. I’m furious with the conditions these men are forced to work with. There’s simply no excuse for that,” she said, gesturing harshly.</p>
<p>He let go of the sturdy, weatherproof fabric of her jacket sleeve, taken aback. “No excuse for what?” “There’s no reason the conveyors should jam. There’s no reason the power couplings on a deck gun should fail in the middle of an assault. It’s are shameful to the Dragoon.”</p>
<p>“You can’t expect—”</p>
<p>“No, hear me,” she began, peering up at him with her distinctive green eyes. “The Clockwork Dragoon has spent five millennia as the cutting edge of mechanical knowledge for the Grand Imperial Fleet. We don’t make mistakes like this.”</p>
<p>“I see what you mean, but there’s nothing that we can do about it, is there?”</p>
<p>“Do you know why you were sent to fetch me, Lombard? I’m sure its not because the Captain values my pleasant company,” she said, sweeping down the spinal corridor towards the bridge.The guards at the bridge stopped Fleurette, uncertain of the procedure.</p>
<p>“Embless, we cannot let you enter the bridge without express authorization,” the one with graying hair told her without eye contact. Despite the authority in his voice, he exuded uncertainty. Fleurette recognized him from bygone days of loyalty, and for that reason alone refrained from causing a small scene over the disservice he was doing to her family.</p>
<p>“Once upon a time, these doors stood open for the Mecanwaithes,” she said scathingly as her escort caught up. Lombard flashed his insignia and the guards open the doors to the foyer of the bridge, bowing particularly deeply.</p>
<p>The Graf led her into the bridge, where Councilman Arnos Mecanwaithe was conferring with Captain Ra-Nydor and a host of tacticians over the situation map. He walked to the Captain’s side, stood at attention, and saluted him, with Fleurette at his side.</p>
<p>“Well, it took you a cursed long time. Where was she, aboard the Glade?”</p>
<p>“My Lord Captain, she was in the aft observation dome. We made inspections of the upper gunnery emplacements before returning to the bridge. I deeply apologize for the lateness of our arrival. The Embless is in no way to blame.”</p>
<p>“So be it, Graf Kitharon. The lives of a further seven men hang on your failure to complete your task in a timely manner.”</p>
<p>“My most humble apologies, Captain. I shall endeavor to make up for my actions.”</p>
<p>“No matter. Time is of the essence, House Mecanwaithe,” the Captain said, turning to Arnos.</p>
<p>Arnos Mecanwaithe, father of Fleurette, beckoned the girl to the situation map of the ship. Despite many fond memories of the map and it’s contents, a small, irrational uncertainty appeared in her for a moment. She crushed it with her determination and stepped forward. As her eyes took it in, the men saw frustration rise on her delicate features. Arnos covertly placed a soothing palm on her hand. With a slight shake of his head, he rebuked her for being affected by the politics of the situation. She buried her displeasure and forced her self into lady-like composure.</p>
<p>“Take a moment and get your bearings, Embless. Speak to any officers you need,” the Captain said, voice thick with condescension.</p>
<p>She gazed at the map a few moments more, locking the shifting patterns of fliers and infantry and cruisers firmly in her mind. Lombard’s pulse began to pump audibly in his ears as he watched her luminescent green eyes absorb the information she needed to save the ship from being torn apart. Throughout the room a quite fell as she scanned the map. It was as though the staff could all feel the flurry of activity rising in her.</p>
<p>“Captain, I need statistics,” she said, hummingbird quiet.</p>
<p>Half a dozen communications officers sounded off.</p>
<p>“Forty percent of the infantry are holding position.”</p>
<p>“Of seven hundred men on deck, one hundred and fourteen are dead. Eighty-five percent are combat ready.”</p>
<p>“All twenty cruisers are sortied, they’re split eleven to seven starboard to port. Two are lost.”</p>
<p>“Central Power reports a nominal feed, ninety-one percent available.”</p>
<p>“Munitions are at seventy-three percent. Four deck gun conveyors are damaged, two other deck guns are currently unable to fire.”</p>
<p>“There are two swarms of pickers. The starboard flock is about fifteen hundred strong. The port is about a thousand.”</p>
<p>“Anything else command can tell me?” Fleurette asked aloud.</p>
<p>“Reinforcements from Eon’s Slumber are on their way. They’ll arrive in approximately twenty minutes.”</p>
<p>“We’ll be peeled by then,” said an anonymous crewman, and an angry murmur passed around the bridge.</p>
<p>The Embless removed her eyeglasses and rubbed the bridge of her slender nose in furious concentration. Lombard suppressed a grin at the gesture.</p>
<p>Replacing her glasses, she turned to Emrus. “Captain, do you agree emergency measures are in order?”</p>
<p>He stiffened at her question, resentful of both the implications and her tone of voice. “I would agree, Miss Mecanwaithe,” he responded, intentionally avoiding her title. Two can play that game, little girl, he thought to himself.</p>
<p>“Central Power, prepare for twenty-five percent expenditure in the next few minutes. Shut down all non-essential systems and manufacturing.”</p>
<p>“Aye Ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Spinal equipment teams. Engage all return dump overrides, and force-clear all jams.”</p>
<p>“Aye Ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Gunnery. Prepare four extra power coupling cables for each deck gun. Prepare downed guns as well, they will follow when they are ready.”</p>
<p>“Aye Ma’am, prepare the couplings for what?”</p>
<p>“Gunnery crews, connect two power couplings from the heat exchange manifold to the main return draw and one to grounding, and keep one spare in case one goes incandescent. Quit staring at me and do it, now!”</p>
<p>Impatient, she tapped her foot for a few moments, giving them time. The Captain gazed at her with barely concealed suspicion and contempt. The Councilman stared back, as impassive as ever.</p>
<p>“Crews report active guns have completed the couplings,” the Gunnery officer reported in a rush of breath.</p>
<p>“Prepare for a solid volley. Central Power, open all capacitors to full power. This is going to dim the lights a bit. Infantry, Craft, get me a swarm.”</p>
<p>“How do you propose we do that?” the Captain interjected angrily.</p>
<p>“I’m here for technical support, not tactical, Captain. I give you the weapons. You give me a target.”</p>
<p>Glaring, he spoke to the Craft officer. He directed the cruisers to circle the flocks until they collapsed into a single tight ball lurching towards the ship.</p>
<p>“I hope you know what you’re doing,” the Captain said to Fleurette, his voice tight.</p>
<p>“Gunnery, prepare to fire on the swarms when they enter range. Do not stop firing unless your weapon overheats. Fire as quickly as the weapon will recharge. Extra crewmen should cool the weapon with the fire hoses. Sound off.”</p>
<p>A chorus of crews sounded off in succession across the entire ship, each getting marked off on the situation map. Fleurette dabbed daintily at her pale brow with a kerchief in relief. The few red signals representing downed guns appeared in tight clumps in the middle of the ship. By chance, they left no areas of fire uncovered.</p>
<p>Fleurette turned to address the Captain again. “My Lord, this strategy will thin the flocks to a level easily handled by the cruisers. The strike is at your option.”</p>
<p>But what she really wanted to say was merely, “You may fire when ready.”</p>
<p>The Captain snatched control of the situation in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>“Spread the fire across the surface of the swarms. Do not bunch up fire on the knots. We’ll take them down, boys. Prepare to fire.”</p>
<p>The swarms rose and flooded towards the ship, in perfect unison.</p>
<p>“FIRE!” cried the Captain, and the lights did indeed dim as the world-shaking thunder of the deck guns erupted across the surface of the Clockwork Dragoon. The thunder continued to thrum throughout the bridge and the rest of the ship.</p>
<p>“Central Power reports eighty-six percent!”</p>
<p>“Observation is occluded by the vapor cloud!”</p>
<p>“E-eighty percent!” stuttered the Central Power officer.</p>
<p>The Captain staggered backwards and Lombard’s jaw swung free. The deck guns had just dumped six percent of the ship’s total power output in less than four seconds.</p>
<p>“Seventy-five percent!”</p>
<p>“Observation!” called the Captain over the roar.</p>
<p>“Observation reports massive enemy losses, statistics unclear, sir!”</p>
<p>“Seventy percent power, Captain!”</p>
<p>Silently, amid the chaos of the bridge, Arnos Mecanwaithe allowed himself a proud smirk at his petite daughter. Her gaze was fixed on the observation scrying screen.</p>
<p>“Sixty-four percent power, Captain!”</p>
<p>“Observation reports the surviving enemy is in total retreat, Captain!”</p>
<p>“Cease fire,” Captain Ra-Nydor said in a stunned half-daze, his words trailing off.</p>
<p>“Losses remain one hundred and fourteen, my Lord.”</p>
<p>“Well done, Captain,” the Councilman said deferentially.Before the battle had even started, there had been warning signs. Radio chatter had erupted across the entire fleet the instant the picker swarm had been spotted leaving the canopy of the Abyssal forest. The ships had all struggled to get away, but there had been no way for the Dragoon to avoid a confrontation. The swarm had boiled up around it in moments.</p>
<p>The warnings had not gone unheeded through the ship, however. They had been intercepted and analyzed by a secretive, hidden part of the ship’s organization. Within minutes of the first broadcasts, a room had been prepared deep in the bowels of the ship. Several men in dark robes had shuffled in separately, arriving by dim, serpentine corridors.</p>
<p>The dark room was lit only by the glowing form of a model of the ship. This model was altogether more detailed than the one on the bridge. It included all the minutiae of the ship’s conduits, from cold water to steam to electricity to magic power. The conduit routes through the model showed flow distributions and energy draws. The model was even detailed enough to show the damage to the external armor and equipment. The men gathered around the model close, using the opportunity to investigate every system. They made notes, saving the arcane details of the ships operation for the future.</p>
<p>As the battle came to a close, one of the figures paused in his writing. He reached forward to a small console that controlled the model. It showcased another improved capability. The man rewound the battle to the beginning and scrubbed through until a shift in technique became apparent again. The others noticed this time as well.</p>
<p>Someone had changed tactics in the middle. Someone with a much more advanced knowledge of the ancient and arcane systems that powered the ship-board weaponry than even Captain Emrus Ra-Nydor.</p>
<p>A Mecanwaithe, no doubt.</p>
<p>The decision was made.</p>
<p>Something had to be done about this.It had been three years since Fleurette had hung her sign and started doing proper business with the men and women of the Fleet. Her workshop had changed quite drastically in the intervening period. She now sat in a smaller, more personal work area inside the House Mecanwaithe building. Her old shop had been sold and taken over for use by their competitors, House Glorgox. She’d been down to it a few times since and it was now used as an office for the Glorgox enclave aboard the Clockwork Dragoon. At the time, the move had stung, but after a few weeks it ended up filed with all the other things their competitor had taken from her.</p>
<p>She had two workshops now, and they were better suited to her work than her first had been. Since the smaller one was situated inside the confines of the family compound, she’d used the sign to identify her bigger shop, down in the belly of the ship.</p>
<p>She set her engraving awl down and used a strip of leather to free the swarf and sat back to inspect her work. It was elegant and refined and far better than when she had started. At the age of sixteen, she was already one of the most sought-after craftspersons in the Fleet. The elegant weapon that lay on her desk was her own production, forged, turned, fitted, and tested in her own workshop. A baron aboard the Favor of Baeus had commissioned it from her last year. He’d sent it back to her to get it engraved with a riddle his wife had written before she passed away.</p>
<p>Fleurette’s handiwork was usually refined and delicate but this piece required an extra touch. She stood to fetch some extra items, retrieving a flexible rubber blade and a small vial of expensive decorative liquid. She took great care in applying individual drops of the clear fluid to the engraving, using a tiny brush to coax it into place. She ran the blade across the surface over and over to clean the surface of extra drops. After applying the liquid, she held her hand over it and let some of her inner reserve of magic flow into the engraving. The liquid hardened and crystallized, forming a perfect bond and raising up in a jeweled filigree that made the weapon look positively priceless.</p>
<p>She buffed the surface to a keen polish and placed the weapon back in the velvet-lined case she’d sold it in. She wrote a little note, thanking the baron for his patronage and offering her condolences for the loss of his wife. She tucked it into the box and set it aside to work on the next project.Fleurette didn’t have a lot of other work to do that day. She’d graduated from the mindwork academies years ago. She attended a finishing school aboard a different ship, but it wasn’t in session. With nothing else to interfere, she spent her time doing Rosethorn &amp; Lotus work and tinkering. Sometimes she tried to sell her inventions to the other Houses, but most of the time her trinkets fell on deaf ears. Nobody wanted to honor House Mecanwaithe anymore, not when they could get cheaper equipment elsewhere.</p>
<p>She drummed her fingers against her desk as she reread a scroll of advanced metaphysics. I suppose it would be more productive to finish all my work today and spend tomorrow prototyping in the bigger workshop, she thought and rolled the scroll up to put it away. She had just reached for the dwindling stack of work orders on her desk when a knock sounded on her door.</p>
<p>She stood and opened the door and found her father standing there. “Morning,” he said, stepping inside and sitting down in a extra chair he’d placed in her workshop just for himself.</p>
<p>Fleurette eyed him with veiled suspicion. He didn’t usually interrupt her during business hours unless it was important.</p>
<p>“You’re giving me the look,” he said.</p>
<p>“Can’t you see I’m busy?” she asked.</p>
<p>Arnos frowned to suppress a smirk. He raised an eyebrow at her clean, empty desk.</p>
<p>“Well, I was about to be.”</p>
<p>“Looks like you’ve got about two orders at the moment,” he observed.</p>
<p>“One of those two could be an order for a ten meter gunship with a gimbal mounted engine,” she huffed, flipping her hair and folding her arms. She turned away from him, but her angular momentum brought her chair all the way back around. When she reappeared again, she was leaning forward with interest.</p>
<p>“Tell me something has gone wrong. I need something to fix.”</p>
<p>“Going a little stir-crazy?” her father asked, chuckling.</p>
<p>“Everyone has slow days,” she shrugged.</p>
<p>“Some more than most,” Arnos said out of the corner of his mouth. “Well, it just so happens that there is something I need you to fix.”</p>
<p>“Pray tell,” she said, looking up at him over the rims of her glasses.</p>
<p>“Well, it may not seem like it, but the ship has done a fair amount of business the last few months.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem that way at all,” she said, pushing her glasses back up and wrapping her arms around her knees.</p>
<p>“Well, my dear, that’s because we’re being ripped off. But that’s neither here nor there. The point is, the spellworks have been turning constantly and no one has requested a cleanup–” Fleurette leaned forward, grinning in anticipation, “–for quite some time now. Yesterday, an entire rack of capacitors went missing. Someone’s got to go down there and do a cleaning.”</p>
<p>“Yay!” Fleurette squeaked, throwing her arms up into the air in triumph.</p>
<p>Arnos shook his head, chagrined. “I wish you’d shown this much enthusiasm when it was a regular duty.”</p>
<p>“That’s neither here nor there,” she echoed, snatching her spellguns Rosethorn and Lotus down off the wall.Once her father had given Fleurette the paperwork for the cleaning mission, Fleurette trotted out of her shop, down a hall, and up a flight of stairs. She came to her own room in the family’s quarters and closed the door before her siblings even noticed her. She kicked her heeled shoes into a bin next to her closet and squiggled out of her skirt and bodice. She snatched a shorter, stiffer skirt out and wrapped it around her waist, fastening it with a sturdy belt. She pulled on pair of thigh-highs that were enchanted to resist damage and cushion her knees. For a top, she settled on her favorite old cleaning blouse. It was tight-fitting but left just enough room to afford her the maneuverability she needed.</p>
<p>Fleurette unlatched a lockaway chest from a cubbyhole in the wall. She pulled out a pair of leather boots that had armored plates affixed to them and pulled them up over her knees, fastening them with straps. She took out her combat jacket and shook it out, releasing a cloud of dust. She slipped the old garment over her shoulders and tested its flexibility as well. She’d need every bit of agility she could afford in the cramped confines of the guts of the spellworks. Last of all, she pulled on a pair armored of gloves that had loops for her fingers, giving her both protection and dexterity.</p>
<p>Fleurette fetched her holsters for her spellguns and strapped them across her hips. They went over the long jacket, lending her a cavalier and rakish air. When she looked at herself in the mirror, she couldn’t help but think she looked like one of those sky pirates from before the War. It wasn’t an image her father and mother liked for her, but they couldn’t refute her outfit’s utility in cleaning missions.</p>
<p>Satisfied with her preparations, Fleurette made her way out of the house and across the Crust to the nearest set of stairs that went to the spellworks. It was a tighter, winding set, almost more of an access shaft. So rarely was it used that she considered this particular stairwell to be her own personal transit.</p>
<p>She passed the middle decks, where laborers were working hard to keep the ship clothed, fed, and running. The sound of industry was loud, even a few floors above the spellworks itself. She passed landing after landing of crowded, busy handworkers as she clanked down the grated stairs.</p>
<p>She came out on the top level of the spellworks. Since there were no stairs that led down below the deck here, she would have to use one of the access hatches scattered around the spellworks. As she looked for one, burly handworkers and clever mindworkers raised their hands in tentative salutes. Some were discrete, others proud.</p>
<p>One of the older workers, a foreman, approached her. “Haven’t seen the Embless down here for some time,” he said. “Anything I can help you with, mistress?”</p>
<p>The genteel respect he accorded her was so rare she blushed. “Councilman Mecanwaithe sent me down for a cleaning. Can you tell me about the problems? I’d like to know where to focus my efforts.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sure, this way,” he said, leading her through the flashing, ringing spellworks. He led her to an access hatch behind a giant shell press that churned out the massive cartridges consumed by the deck guns. The crew operating the machine took a valuable moment to salute her.</p>
<p>“Councilman Mecanwaithe must have told you about the missing equipment. That machine over there lost an entire rack down between those plates a few days ago. We’re already short-stocked, so we can’t afford to let the critters keep eating our supplies.” The foreman unlocked and lifted up the hatch, revealing the labyrinthine crawlspace.</p>
<p>“The mindworkers tell me they’ve tracked the buggers over to that side. Seems like there’s a lot of them, might even be a nest, what with all the shit they’ve eaten— Oh my goodness, pardon my language.”</p>
<p>Fleurette smiled up at him sweetly. “Don’t worry about it, Foreman Rolbix. I know the environment.” She looked down the crawlspace, her apprehensive outweighed by her excitement. “Do you think it’s mostly magical or mechanical in nature?” She asked, stepping down into the darkened tunnel.</p>
<p>“Probably mechanical. Most of the stuff they’ve taken has been servos and the like.”</p>
<p>Fleurette changed cartridges in her spellguns while sitting on the edge of the deck. “Can you shut down those machines for me? It’ll only take a little while.”</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” he said, flagging down the operators as he hustled over to them. Once the machines over the infected area were quiet, he gave her the signal. Fleurette crouched down into the intestinal passageway and lit a small magic light that she affixed to her jacket. She drew Rosethorn from its holster and skulked down the passageway. She depressed the trigger halfway, using the sighting light show her the way ahead. Despite the area’s claustrophobic atmosphere, she felt comfortably at home. She’d been hunting the Dragoon’s gremlins down here since she was a little girl. It wasn’t the safest occupation for a young woman, but for a number of years she had been the only person able do fill the role. She was the only one with the knowhow, tools, and a small enough build to investigate problems under the spellworks.</p>
<p>She smiled as she slid forward, checking the connecting shafts and spaces for creatures. It was nice to be needed. The fact that the ship had requested the services of House Mecanwaithe proved that they hadn’t yet become obsolete.</p>
<p>Fleurette had barely gotten five meters along the crawlspace before the signs of parasites appeared. The light from her gun and her lamp reflected off glossy, slimy, crystalline structures strung between the cables and pipes. The parasites left behind the strange material when they fed on the power lines below the floor. Fleurette made note of the composition and kept moving. There’d be time to deal with the mess after she had removed the source of the problem.</p>
<p>Up ahead, the stringy leavings grew in density. She was nearing a power hub that led to several of the machines above. It had to be the location of the nest.</p>
<p>Tiny, hissing faces appeared in the darkness, their mechanical, bio-ethereal bodies glimmering in the light of her weapon. Fleurette jumped, firing a trio of shots down the passage at them. She panted for breath. The critters had startled her. Once she had regained he composure, she slid forward, inspecting the carnage. The little bodies were about the length of her forearm, long and slender like a lizard. She reached backward for her bag, but her fingers found nothing there. She’d forgotten to bring anything for transporting the detritus.</p>
<p>Sighing, she decided to push on with the investigation and fetch a bag later. She didn’t feel like backing up all the way to the entrance already. The stockings she wore were magically enhanced to protect her legs and she wore armor up to her knees, but they were already getting sore from kneeling on the hard, hot pipes and chutes.</p>
<p>Fleurette slid into a slightly larger area under the deck of the spellworks. It was tall enough for her to sit upright. In the center of the space was the power hub. It was connected to the main engine by a cable as thick as her torso that snaked down into the darkness beyond. Little traceries of light were everywhere, indicating the load and status of the power cables that hooked into the hub. The hub itself was a knotted cluster of circuits and ducts covered in a thick mantle of crystallized parasite slime.</p>
<p>Fleurette was wondering where they had all gone when she realized that they were watching her from inside the tight coils of machinery surrounding the area. She couldn’t shoot them without damaging the organs of the spellworks, so she sat there, paralyzed, as she tried to come up with a plan. Dozens of beady, mechanical eyes watched her every movement as she crawled past the hub and down the access shaft towards the main engine.</p>
<p>The engine compartment was located in a reinforced shell located in the bowels of the ship. There wasn’t much indication of parasitism around the compartment, but she wasn’t surprised. The main engine was the most heavily guarded, tightly warded part of the entire ship. Only the writ of permission she carried in her pocket protected her from the core’s defense mechanisms, and for good reason. Mutiny would be all too easy if anyone could crawl through an access hatch to the main engine compartment. Even if every other system failed, a proficient and determined mage could at least keep the ship in the air from where she crouched.</p>
<p>She turned around, trying to keep her eyes on the parasite nest as she fiddled with the console for the main engine. She could feel the energy of the thing as she touched it. She knew it was impossible; the containment fields and recirculation systems retained every micro-curon of mana that the thing emitted, but nevertheless, she felt like the divine artifact that powered the ship was calling out to her.</p>
<p>She directed the console to vent a tiny amount of energy into the heat exchange manifold. It operated instantly, filling the compartment with a distinct gong. Even the tiny fraction of energy she asked for caused the radiator to suddenly glow sky blue with energy. The hungry eyes of twenty or thirty parasites appeared in the access shaft, smelling the sharp tang of magic. They flooded down the shaft towards her. She whipped out Lotus and opened fire with both weapons, blasting the crush of bodies into a heap of recyclable materials.</p>
<p>Several critters tried to escape, but she picked them off from the safety of the engine compartment. Her little guns stood no chance of damaging any of the core equipment, making it easier her for to pick her targets. Soon, the only sound was the distant slamming and grinding of the spellworks above.As the smoke cleared by way of the internal cooling system, Fleurette cast a spell to detect whether there were any more parasites lurking. It seemed the area was clear, so she took a moment to relax. The blue-white energy glowing from the radiator was dissipating, leaving it orange with mundane heat. The console readouts were all fine, indicating the reactor was within the limits.</p>
<p>She blinked a couple of times, perplexed. Her brow knitted in concentration as she studied the ancient, arcane readouts on the main engine console. There were no errors displayed, per se, but something was… off.</p>
<p>The console depicted a number of trace lines, each indicating some parameter of the engine’s performance. The lines were mostly flat or oscillating very slightly, except for the one that indicated the minuscule drop in power when she had vented energy for her distraction. But earlier, near the end of the displayed range, there was a momentary drop in the overall power output of the engine. It was startlingly brief, and the graph returned to the proper output level after it, but that single little vertical dip in the line could mean disaster. The complex, esoteric graph held a number of warnings in the ancient tongue, but none of them said anything about the drop, as though it was so brief that the correction systems hadn’t noticed it. Nevertheless, if the engine output was dropping out occasionally, it was certain to do so at the most inopportune time. If the power dropped in the middle of a siege, it could spell doom for the entire ship.</p>
<p>The miraculous eight-lirex engine that powered the liftstones that kept the Clockwork Dragoon aloft was only about a meter in each dimension, but inside it was an ancient, divine artifact of such absurdly prodigious power that it produced one hundred and fourteen mega-curons of mana per second. The liftstone used to keep the ship in the sky drew fifty-nine mega-curons, the deck guns thirty five, and the manufacturing sections twenty, with all the other systems taking adding up to barely a tenth of a mega-curon. She checked the depth of the drop and gasped. Sixty mega-curons, enough to shut down the deck guns and manufacturing, and even then, start to degrade the liftstone performance. Her mind raced with the implications. The only reason that no one had noticed was that the drop had been so brief; it may not have even been perceptible at the time. But if the drop occurred during peak load, say in the middle of a siege, the guns would stop, the liftstone charge would dissipate, and the ship would drop like a seventy-thousand ton rock.</p>
<p>Fleurette inspected the engine itself, looking for any evidence of damage or (heaven forbid) tampering. The top side of the engine was covered with plugs and cables, making it difficult to assess, but the sides were slightly corroded, with white flakes loosening from the seams and corners. Agitated, she took out a arcanometer and touched the leads to two points on the surface of the engine. The needle jumped immediately, topping the gauge out at ten kilo-curons. She’d been right when she felt the energy rolling off the engine; shockingly, there was enough energy escaping the containment system to run the entire communications system aboard the ship.</p>
<p>Fleurette considered. The engine was still mostly stable. Nobody else had noticed a problem yet, and that meant that the issue was still in the early stages; it was still repairable. The corrosion was typical of high arcane stress on old magesteel, but the fact that the engine was leaking meant that the containment system was beginning to fail. And clearly, this excess energy was what had drawn the scavengers.</p>
<p>Fleurette had always been the sort of person who lost herself in a challenge. Her mind was already teasing at the threads of this knot, trying to think of a way to fix the containment system without grounding the ship. For the moment, though, there was other work to be done. As she collected the junk from the parasites and cleaned up the hub station, she pondered the possibilities. Engines had been replaced before; her family had been the ones entrusted with that duty in the past. But she couldn’t remember anyone ever doing it with the ship still in flight. If she explained her newly-formed strategy, even her own father would have told her that it was impossible. But Fleurette had been told that before.Deep in the mansion built and owned by House Mecanwaithe generations ago, a portion of the family prepared for an important day. The eldest daughter of the family was about to embark on another season of schooling aboard a distant ship. To Arnos Mecanwaithe, it was apparent that school simply didn’t interest her as much now as it had in the past. She it was unusual for her to be so distant with her family, but Arnos recognized the look on her face as one of intense concentration. It was the expression she wore when she was puzzling over a particularly interesting problem. He sighed and turned back to the task of boxing her arcane tomes, a chagrined smile on his face. Like father, like daughter, the thought.</p>
<p>Fleurette shuffled some engine plans, papers and sketches into a booklet and placed them among the other school materials casually, hoping neither of the others noticed.</p>
<p>“Father, in light of the siege the other day, don’t you think it’d be better if I stayed here on the Dragoon and learned more about my trade?”</p>
<p>“Fleurette, I know you want to spend all your time here working and learning, but there are principles to follow. There are many things people in society must do, and if you fail to do them, you risk losing what little respect our family still has. Unfortunately, sometimes, honey, you just have to play ball.”</p>
<p>They quietly resumed packing her things into the two large chests emblazoned with the family crest. While her father and her little sister Caelyx packed her clothes, she focused her efforts on the catastrophe that was her workbench.</p>
<p>“Fleu! Fleu!” her sister suddenly blurted, still unable to keep her composure for more than a few minutes, even at the age of thirteen. She held up a beautiful dress of the family colors with layers and layers of ruffles and a slim and elegant bodice. It was almost small enough for her little sister to wear. “You should take this! It’s wondrous!”</p>
<p>Fleurette turned to for a glance at the garment. A look of apprehension surfaced on her face. “I’m not sure that’s still in style, sis.”</p>
<p>Unperturbed, Caelyx tossed the dress onto the thick comforter on the bed with an audible whump. She dove back into the closet, looking for more treasure. “How about this one?”</p>
<p>Fleurette turned again, this time unable to make a decision on how she felt about the dress. It was a simple dress compared to the current fashion of lace, but it featured a certain elegance to its lines.</p>
<p>“Oh for goodness sake,” Arnos said, grabbing both dresses with his rough fingers and stuffing them into the portable wardrobe he and Caelyx were attempting to fill. “You won’t get very far with three dresses, dear. And why isn’t your mother helping with this, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Mother was all in tears when I asked if she’d help,” said Caelyx, making sad eyes at her father.</p>
<p>“By the Crown. We do this every year… and it’s not as though we’re lacking for daughters,” Arnos grumbled, eyes darting to Fleurette. She tried to look upset, but couldn’t quite suppress her smirk over his playful jabs.</p>
<p>“When Reccus goes to the Iron Duke, I’ll be the oldest Mecanwaithe on the whole ship!” Caelyx declared. She cast an armload of undergarments onto the bed, rather than the chest, and flopping ostentatiously upon the covers.</p>
<p>“Except for Grandpa. He might still be older than you,” Fleurette mocked playfully. “And put those away properly, you embarrassment.”</p>
<p>She gets up and placed the clothes in the portable wardrobe with the affluent air of a queen. “Oh, you know what I mean. Father, why can’t I go with Fleu to the Lady of Blades?”</p>
<p>“For the trillionth time, Caelyx, you’ll go when you’re 14. I’m sorry, but we just don’t have the money to send you to the Lady for preparatory school.”</p>
<p>“Caelyx, haven’t you got a bunch of studying to do this year? If you want to be ‘the best mindworker in the entire fleet,’ that is.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t say I need a LOT more studying, my dear sister,” she replied, nose in the air.</p>
<p>“Come here, you!” Fleurette cried as she grabbed her escaping little sister and pinned her to the bed for a final tickle-battle.</p>
<p>Amid the squeaks of delight and panic Arnos said, “I give up. Have your mother help you,” and then shuffled out the door to find his wife.Hours later, and only hours before she was due to depart, Fleurette met with Lombard in the main hexadome, the central meeting place in the Crust of the ship. He’d arrived earlier than she and had been waiting for some time, but his face lit up as she appeared in the crowd.</p>
<p>His heart leapt at the sight of her; she wasn’t wearing her usual worn work clothes. Instead, she wore something closer to casual clothes. She had on a short, red skirt with pockets around the belt that had a little gold bow in front and a big red one in the back. It cleverly matched the one in her hair. Her top was a cross-laced bodice with its own bows and golden detailing. She wore supple, elegant gloves that reached to her elbows and red stockings that left only a little thigh showing below her skirt. Her outfit was almost too provocative. Several men she passed stopped to stare and a few ladies turned their noses up in jealousy.</p>
<p>“You look splendid,” he gushed.</p>
<p>“Thank you. You’re looking rather dapper today, yourself,” she said, returning his compliment and taking in his proud double-breasted uniform and his numerous commendations from the Iron Duke.</p>
<p>Wary of improper public intimacy, they allowed themselves only a brief embrace.</p>
<p>“All packed up?” he asked, by way of creating conversation.</p>
<p>“I am. It was quite a chore, despite all the help. I might have gotten it done sooner by myself.”</p>
<p>“Well, there’s still a few hours before you’ve got to go, right?”</p>
<p>“Lombard, I never really apologized for getting short with you the other day. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“What? When? Oh, you mean during the battle?”</p>
<p>“Yes. When I was talking about my family.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry your pretty head over it, Fleurette, it was a combat situation. You’re not exactly trained to deal with those kind of events. I’m sorry I wasn’t more of a gentleman.”</p>
<p>“You’re always a gentleman, Lombard.”</p>
<p>“I hope you’re parents feel the same way,” he said out of the side of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Oh Lombard, you know that courtship is supposed to take a long time, these are not things to be rushed.”</p>
<p>“Eight months is a long time for us to be apart.”</p>
<p>“We will not be apart eight months. There’s a feast or a dance or a ball almost bi-monthly. Quit your grousing. Besides, if it really bothers you, I’ll send you a radio and we can talk every night until you get sick of me.”</p>
<p>“That’ll never happen,” he said, leaning closer to her.</p>
<p>“Public places,” she chided, but she tiptoed to kiss him anyway.What seemed like moments later, Embless Fleurette Mecanwaithe was through the sea of tearful goodbyes and the forest of suffocating hugs and settled aboard a transport craft called the Polite Request.</p>
<p>As she sat down, the Captain slipped past her in the cramped aisle. He was a tall, chiseled man no more than six or seven years Fleurette’s senior. Fleurette watched him pass, as did every other girl in the passenger compartment.</p>
<p>Once he had entered the cockpit, a pleasant flight attendant came to her seat.</p>
<p>“We’ll be bringing a tray of sweets around once we’re in the air. What sort of tea would you like?” she asked. Fleurette glanced at the other girls on the ship. She decided to take the opportunity to practice her manners.</p>
<p>“Darjeeling would be lovely, if you have it on hand,” she said, smiling up at the attendant like a spring breeze. The other girls, who had been taking the last few moments aboard the Dragoon to get their childish giggles out, took notice and settled properly into their seats. Their giggles bloomed into polite conversation as Fleurette hid a smirk.</p>
<p>Shortly, the small craft rocked slightly as its landing spars left the deck. Each of the young passengers craned her head to watch out the window.</p>
<p>Despite their excitement, the chatter was kept at a decorous level as the Captain guided the craft away from the aft docks of the Clockwork Dragoon and out into the open air. The attendant came around with the promised tray of sweets and poured tea while the Captain oriented the ship.</p>
<p>As the Request pulled from the atmospheric control area of the Dragoon, the girls’ attention darted from their delicious treats to the windows. After the outer glass froze to the same temperature as the air at five thousand meters, the portals revealed the ocean of clouds comprising the Lightning Sea. Amongst the flickery arcs the girls spotted dozens of smaller craft at the edge of the patrol volume. The Request sped up substantially and angled around towards the middle of the Grand Imperial Fleet where the Lady of Blades usually resided. The wide turn revealed a number of the larger ships in the fleet at long distances. The hulking behemoths of Eon’s Slumber and the Celestial Forge loomed in up in the clouds, causing squeals of delight and gasps of awe to escape the passengers.</p>
<p>The Request quickly passed over the massive bulk of the Dragoon and hundreds of inhabitants fired confetti and sparkling spell bursts out of the hull to wish the girls well. The banking turns made it easy for Fleurette to gaze down at the Abyss through the small openings in the Lightning Sea. She saw the massive forms of forestwalkers and dragons and other hideously large monstrosities thrashing amongst the massive trees. Other girls picked up on her view and a completely different kind of sound spread through the cabin.It took the better part of an hour for the Polite Request to close the distance between the Dragoon and the Lady. Captain Salazar guided the ship at a leisurely pace so that the passengers didn’t notice the waiting required for a landing slot.</p>
<p>“Polite Request, we’ve got you in the tenth bracket. Please loiter until the deck is clear, then proceed to docking zone,” the uptight voice of the control officer aboard the Lady said. Captain Salazar rolled his eyes and turned to look at his attendant.</p>
<p>“This is going to take all afternoon,” he grumbled to her.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to serve some more snacks?” she asked.</p>
<p>“We’d better. I’ll see what I can do to keep them entertained.”</p>
<p>Captain Salazar peered out the canopy at the Fleet. Ahead of him, a queue of transports waited to enter the docking zone. The small craft at the front were from the Emperor’s Watchdog, the Glory of Advar, and the Eon’s Slumber. He rolled his eyes again, wishing he could call them out for cutting in line. He hated the way they discarded the girls from the Dragoon and the other ships, as though they were less valuable members of the Fleet. He would have wagered the girls aboard his vessel as worthy as any three of the brats unloading their wardrobes and chests and curios to the landing deck.</p>
<p>Captain Salazar bore the Request up and away from the queue. The radio chirped at him in anger, but he snapped it off with a practiced flick. He pulled the ship up and around, out over the open space between the great ships of the Fleet.</p>
<p>He dusted off his book of manners and clicked on the intercom. “My deepest apologies for our delay, ladies. In the mean time, I’ve been instructed to give you all a bit of a tour of the Grand Imperial Fleet. Please enjoy some more refreshments and I’ll do my best to show you some interesting sights.”</p>
<p>Behind him, he heard the excited voices of his passengers chattering to each other.</p>
<p>Captain Salazar guided the ship in a wide arc, orbiting the Lady of Blades in an elliptical that would eventually take them out of its patrol radius.</p>
<p>“If you look down and to starboard, you’ll see the Iron Duke. The Duke, I’m sure you know, is where our soldiers and marines go to train. A lesser known fact is that the Duke also houses some of the largest aeroponic gardens in the entire Fleet, producing mainly grapes, berries, and other fruits.”</p>
<p>He banked the ship slightly so the windows lined up with another sight.</p>
<p>“We’re coming up on the patrol radius of the Lady of Blades now. If you look out the port window, you’ll see one of the patrol ships. These ships are small, agile craft that use radios to alert their motherships to danger.”</p>
<p>Captain Salazar opened the throttle, smoothly speeding up until the ship hit one hundred meters per second. The girls cheered, giggling and shrieking at the speed. He guessed that most of them had never actually flown as fast before.</p>
<p>He brought the ship around, continuing his orbit. Within minutes, he was passing the foremost ships of the fleet.</p>
<p>“Off the starboard side again, you will see three ships. In the middle is the Emperor’s Watchdog, on which the Kaiser Admiral of the Grand Imperial Fleet holds his court. That smaller golden ship docked with it is his personal cruiser, the Strength of Kings. To the right of the Watchdog is the Shining Crown, known for its monks, temples, shrines, and magic. To the left is the Glory of Advar, whose seers and navigators guide the Fleet through the Swath.”</p>
<p>Salazar tipped his wing to the Watchdog. “All hail the Emperor of mankind,” he chanted. He could hear the girls follow along with the old oath. “May his servant guide us.”</p>
<p>A soft chime interrupted his concentration. He keyed off the intercom and flicked the radio back on.</p>
<p>“Polite Request, the grid is clear. We’re ready when you are.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, control. We’ll be along shortly.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your patience, Captain Salazar,” the control officer said. He could hear her nose in the air.</p>
<p>“You’re quite welcome dear. Can I interest you in some drinks when I get down?”</p>
<p>“Your landing space is number three,” she replied uneasily.</p>
<p>“Thanks again,” he said, teasing the control officer with a taste of his seductive voice.</p>
<p>He rolled the ship around to cut the orbit short, aiming just past the Lady of Blades.</p>
<p>“Settle in, my dear passengers, we’re going to take a shortcut back to the Lady of Blades.”</p>
<p>His attendant came in and sat in the copilot seat, crossing her elegant legs. He nodded to her and she shook her head at him in caution. A predatory grin snuck onto his face and he pushed the throttle wide open. The Request kicked back, pushing them all into their chairs. More delighted squawks echoed from the passenger compartment as the dial climbed steadily towards two hundred meters per second. Salazar let out a whoop and let the throttle back down.</p>
<p>They decelerated smoothly towards their approach vector, making a wide, rolling turn into the empty queue lane. He gently coaxed the ship into the Lady’s landing platform, setting her down with barely a bump. He unstrapped and opened the door to the passenger compartment, trying to keep the smugness from his face.</p>
<p>“Thank you for flying with the Polite Request,” he said. The awed faces of the young women stared back at him in dreamy silence. A few nodded.</p>
<p>When none of them moved to get up, he said, “I hope you all enjoyed the ride.”</p>
<p>His attendant’s hand smacked into her own face. She stood and elbowed past Salazar and clapped her hands together to bring the girls back from their fantasies. “Let’s get your things unloaded, shall we?”Captain Salazar returned his attendant’s bow. Since the Lady of Blades was her destination as well, he was on his own again. He followed the girls into the ship, trying to remember where to get a drink. His passengers were already ahead of him, shouldering into the squeeze of girls pushing carts and carrying bags and lugging chests. He glanced to the sides, looking for another exit, but none presented itself. Much of the Lady of Blades was designed to impress, and the grand entrance hall was the first impression. If any less-monumental doors existed, they were well hidden.</p>
<p>Salazar shuffled along behind the high-pitched crowd, entering the entrance hall with mild interest. The elaborate frescoes and golden balustrades reminded him of a golden age. Long eons before he was born, all people had lived like this, with rich furnishings and crystal chandeliers. Now, only highest of upper echelons could afford to even send their children to a a school this luxurious for a few years. He shook his head in mild disappointment.</p>
<p>Salazar ducked away from the prying eyes of radio reporters and slipped among the crowd. The entrance hall had exits to the sides that conducted students to the six academies aboard the ship, but the exit at the far end was what he was aiming for. The furthest exit led to the ship interior, where the adults and staff worked to keep the ship running. Somewhere in there he’d be able to find a drink. All he had to do was slip through hundreds of rich, excited girls and young women.</p>
<p>He could feel their eyes on him. To protect the virtue of the students, the majority of the staff was either female, married, or ancient. The girls watched him like a thousand hungry birds, eager to snatch him up. He sighed quietly and excused his way through the crowd, towards respite and solitude.Tossed like a bird in the storm, Fleurette was buffeted from all sides as she searched for her friends and colleagues from last year. Her group dispersed almost immediately, leaving her stuck in a stream of girls from the Shining Crown. Amongst their pale blue and white robes and their quiet, restrained personalities, her family’s deep red and bright gold colors were embarrassingly flagrant. The girls in other groups she passed giggled and peaked their eyebrows in disdain as she passed.</p>
<p>“Oh good, the politics have already started,” she said to herself.</p>
<p>Part of the way to her designated class area, in a gap in the crowd, she caught the eye of another young woman. She was dressed sumptuously in rich purple and polite black, lacy and gothic in the apex of modern fashion. She was surrounded by a coven of dark beauties whose icy disdain made the others feel like a cool breeze, but in the middle of their negative space was that girl. Her eyes alighted on Fleurette, having just looked up from her conversation. They were completely without preconception or prejudice. One of the girl’s followers intercepted Fleurette’s view, saying something to their little queen and causing her to laugh. Fleurette’s path blessed her with a new view of that smile, one so carefree and disarming she almost stumbled into someone before her.</p>
<p>“Oh! Pardon me,” she said, only half paying attention.</p>
<p>“No,” replied the person she almost collided with. She whirled about with an eyebrow arched to face the familiar voice.</p>
<p>The man stood only a little taller than her one-hundred fifty-seven centimeters, but he must have been nearly three times her weight if not more. His red and gold jacket, pocket vest, and jovial grin marked him as a fellow from the Dragoon. Fleurette’s tense shoulders relaxed.</p>
<p>“What kind of teacher would let his student get away with such base behavior aboard the Lady of Blades?” he said, affecting a stuffy timbre.</p>
<p>“I thought all the teachers at the Finishing Academy were supposed to be female,” she mocked, playfully suspicious.</p>
<p>“They are. I’m not with the Academy. I’m your personal tutor, Solbus Ilorgan,” he chuckled. Decades of smiles crinkled his eyes. He also seemed to be missing his eyebrows, a popular trait in men from the Dragoon.</p>
<p>“My father must have sent you,” she said. He did remind her of her father, only in a different aspect ratio.</p>
<p>“He did indeed, and it was Thawyl that selected me for the duty. I’m here to continue your training in the arts of our home-ship as much as you have time and inclination to do so.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful! I’d been fearing that I’d be stuck here with nothing but dresses and crumpets to learn about.” She curtsied to him, and he bowed respectfully.</p>
<p>“I’m not so knowledgeable in those things, but there, look that-a-way, your class area is filling up.”</p>
<p>“Would you stop by my rooms after dinner so we can make a schedule, Master Ilorgan?”</p>
<p>“I shall, and I’ll show you to my own, where I have a sizable laboratory and workshop already set up for us.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much for coming!” she said, scurrying with renewed vigor towards her designated gathering point. She slipped amongst the crowds, throwing her high society manners to the wind in the rush to find her place in the crowd. Soon, she found familiar the uniforms of her classmates.</p>
<p>“Fleurette? Fleurette!” cried a familiar voice. Fleurette whirled to find her old friend rushing down the stairs from the Academy. They wrapped each other in hugs.</p>
<p>“Cybeline! How have you been?” she asked, nearly jumping up and down in happiness.</p>
<p>“Bored,” she replied with a twist of her lips. “I’ve been here for weeks already. My parents sent me early.”</p>
<p>“I’m so glad you’re here!” Fleurette said, hugging her again. “I’ve so been lonely lately. I hate coming to school and not knowing anyone.”</p>
<p>“Lucky for us, then,” Cybeline replied. “Can I help you with your bags? I’m already unpacked of course, and I’d feel terrible for letting you carry everything yourself.”</p>
<p>“Well, alright,” Fleurette agreed, passing one of the smaller bags to her friend.</p>
<p>She looked around at the class, trying to put names to the sea of faces. She was shocked to find the striking beauty from before in her class area, waiting with the rest of them. She looked up, noticing Fleurette again in an echo. Cybeline stepped closer to Fleurette to protect her from the cool stares of the other girls. She was well practiced at keeping her friend Fleurette out of the searchlight of the gossips. Fleurette didn’t know whether to hide or to peer around Cybeline at the dark-haired enchantress.</p>
<p>The the soft music stopped and the representative called the class together as the chimes sounded the end of the reunion. Their new teacher stepped down from the stairs to introduce herself. She was bespectacled, shriveled, clawed, and was possessed by a great halo of dull hair.</p>
<p>“I am Miss Mathusus, your instructor for the year. It is a pleasure to meet you all,” she crooned. “Please follow me to your dorms.”“And this portion here, this large block of gears and gizmos, is the loading mechanism. This is the bit that moves the spell cartridges into the gun bore before they’re shot, and helps remove them afterward.”</p>
<p>Another hand shot up in the class, between faces of astonished curiosity and snooty contempt. Miss Mathusus, waved the hand aside, as eager to hear the next bit as the students. “Questions at the end, please,” she said, gesturing with her grotesquely long fingernails for Fleurette to continue.</p>
<p>“So the spell cartridge, sometimes called a ‘shell’ is loaded back here and the equipment closes the breech, or rear, of the gun. Now we’re loaded. Next we have to charge the cartridge. Most ships have this cable here that couples the gun system to a power generator. There’s usually a backup generator for the guns and it’s usually disassociated with the rest of the grid so that lights and ovens and such don’t interfere with the weapons.” Fleurette gulped down a breath of air and a glass of water. Her presentation was already as long as the time limit for the project, but she was barely two thirds of the way through with her explanation.</p>
<p>“The cartridge is charged by these little paddles here, which fill it with magical energy. The cartridge walls have runes on them that perform the necessary magic to turn the raw magical power from the generator into the right kind of magic to fire a blast that will do some damage.”</p>
<p>“What kind of magic is that? Evocation?” blurted one student.</p>
<p>“Conjuration?” asked another girl.</p>
<p>“SHH!” said the teacher.</p>
<p>“It depends on the effect. Most shells are a combination of several types. But anyway, once the cartridge is charged, the gunnery crew just has to aim the gun. Most systems let them do this at the same time as charging the cartridge. Once they’re aimed, loaded, and charged, the crew usually calls a ’Ready!’ state and the gunnery officer fires the weapon.”</p>
<p>“BANG!” exclaimed another girl, and the class lit up with laughter, including Fleurette. She hadn’t imagined in her wildest dreams that her knowledge of ship systems would begin to counteract her family reputation on the Lady of Blades. Most families were constantly engaged in the struggle to raise their rank, while House Mecanwaithe seemed to be on a downward spiral. Her father’s marriage to Duchess Ourie Ra-Iwun had done little to elevate their status. In fact, it had slightly tarnished the entire family of Ra-Iwun rather than strengthening either family’s interests.She fielded questions about her presentation for twenty minutes, barely needing to think about them. Her mind was elsewhere.</p>
<p>She knew what the problem was. It was their power. Her family, House Mecanwaithe, was the sole arbiter of new technology. Certainly there were other manufacturing ships, such as the Celestial Forge and the Maw of Noxura, and it was true that the Dragoon did fairly little actual manufacturing, but that didn’t change their purpose. Young women went to the Lady of Blades and the Argent Glade to learn manners. Young men went to the Iron Duke and Eon’s Slumber to learn warmaking. Young and old, men and women all convened at a single ship, the Clockwork Dragoon for one purpose alone, and that was technology. The knowledge of the House was absolutely indispensable to the Fleet.</p>
<p>That’s the reason they want our power, Fleurette thought to herself, still answering questions. And somehow this knowledge and power had actually helped her popularity at school. The more she helped the others with their work, the less they despised her. Most of them, in her own class at least, had toned their behavior down to mere glares and icy indifference. Many of the indifferent ones were now passingly decent to her. It was quite a change from last year.</p>
<p>Fleurette’s new problem was that the other girls had now identified her as a resource. Almost everyone in the class came to her with their questions about almost every subject. Last year’s grades and her current performance had given them all the impression she was some kind of omniscient genius. Clearly, they felt that her intelligence meant that she didn’t need to study, because they kept bombarding her with their own assignments.After her question and answer session, she looked for another girl for her afternoon’s studies. Her eyes went immediately to the one seat whose occupant she had not drawn, but she had made up her mind not to get involved with her, that girl, from the first day. Her posse vibrated around her every moment she spent out of class, like so many ravens around a rabbit. Fleurette pulled her eyes away, not desiring to get involved with the black queen.</p>
<p>The girl she picked to covertly sketch today was a little older than the rest of the class, but she had short, perfectly cut hair in a strange blue-green shade. She had nice facial structure, pretty eyes, and a cute nose, but that wasn’t the reason Fleurette chose her to draw. She was running out of students to sketch, so she found herself drawing the others twice or three times just to avoid looking too closely at the black queen. And so she settled on this girl, whose name was Liori or Fiori or something along those lines, and studied her face once again. She removed her little drawing book from her soft leather bag and clamped it to the desk with her forearm, covering it from view by the others. She laid the first strokes, lightly penciling in the girl’s precious features. She settled into a rhythm as the next student started her presentation, drifting between the speaker, her drawing subject, and the black queen.She made her first sketch of the black queen, that elusive princess, only days later. Having run out of other girls to sketch in the comfort and ease of the classroom, and having drawn many of them twice, she finally decided to capture the last girl. She spent what seemed like only moments on the drawing before class was abruptly over, leaving her with a partially finished eye and a wisp of dark hair, a sketch she felt she’d never get to finish.</p>
<p>There were other sketches, made outside of her classes. She sketched the architecture of the vaulting of the grand dining room. She sketched the Lightning Sea. She sketched the gun emplacements on the Lady of Blades, the teachers at dinner, Master Solbus’s work table, mechanical components from her workshop, the way the gauzy fabric of the curtains hung in the morning light, and Captain Salazar of the Polite Request. She sketched people outside of class, but she never had as much time with them as the ones in class.</p>
<p>But that elusive princess, that distant young lady. The sketch in her notebook was tantalizing, promising beautiful curves and smooth shading if only she could capture her in her entirety.</p>
<p>So she tried. Fleurette took her notebook and pencils and spent more time than ever on the campus of the Finishing Academy. She couldn’t admit at first that she was even looking for her, but it was a difficult conclusion to miss. She spent time where lots of people passed, the hallways, corridors, lobbies, and foyers of the Lady. When that course of action failed to yield results, she widened her search. She began to track who the girl spent time with, subtly shadowing them in their daily movements across the ship, to no avail. The black queen was a ghost, haunting only the school and utterly invisible elsewhere.</p>
<p>It came as quite a surprise when Fleurette came across her the first time, off campus. She was sketching the articulation hydraulics of the ship’s upper armor plating when the girl appeared from a similar access catwalk, moving gracefully to the gleaming pistons. She peered at them curiously, arousing Fleurette’s interest that she might be a like-minded individual, someone mechanically inclined. Her hand flew across the paper, defining her form with light and shadow for the fleeting moments she remained.</p>
<p>The next time set a trend. Fleurette spotted her leaving a cluster of sycophants and heading in the direction of the top deck stairs. Rather than following her directly, she padded up the stairs on the other side of the line of symmetry, ending up on a spacious top deck interrupted by heavy lift equipment and occasional panel openings marked with hatched warning paint. The gleaming cylinder of a hydraulic arm of drew the girl’s attention and she wandered that way, running her fingers mysteriously over its polished chrome surface.</p>
<p>The light was against the girl, casting her silhouette across the armored deck to Fleurette. She dove to the side as the girl suddenly vaulted up the side of the liftstone, settling in a reclined position facing the sun.</p>
<p>Producing her pencils and book, Fleurette rushed into a frenzy of sketching and drawing, but she couldn’t capture that repose, the strange, surreal elegance of the girl in the lacy black and glowing violet. Every piece of paper seemed to have catastrophic flaws, imperfections that caught the lead the wrong way.</p>
<p>She was well into her fifth sketch when some other people, presumably courting nobles, issued forth from the stairwells and proceeded to completely ruin Fleurette’s mood. Casting a look back at the sunset, she found the girl was already gone.Back in her room, halfheartedly tinkering with bits of electro-magical junk, Fleurette flipped through her sketchbook, beaming at her good fortune. The drawings were rough, but they had a spirit to them that her other drawings lacked. Despite the fact that the sketches scarcely even glimpsed the girl’s cheek, Fleurette felt they had more personality than her earlier attempts. Her artistic skills came from her draftsman training, so her drawing tended to be precise and realistic. Her sketches of the black queen were the opposite, active and gestural, almost impressionistic.</p>
<p>Solbus sneaked up behind her inelegantly and clapped her shoulder in his hand, startling her. She closed her sketchbook and turned to him, gathering her wits.</p>
<p>“Yes, Master Ilorgan?”</p>
<p>“You’ve got work,” he said, nodding at the basket of parts next to her sketchbook.</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” she sighed. Before long, a pattern emerged in the appearances of Fleurette’s target, making it easier for Fleurette to find her. Despite the girl’s mysterious absences, she came to the upper decks of the Lady with some regularity. To Fleurette’s eye, she seemed to enjoy the open air, the scent of the garden pads, and the tumultuous vistas. She was drawn there, as though these sensations promised some unknowable freedom. Fleurette watched her several times, wondering what arcane, mysterious thoughts tumbled through her troubled mind.</p>
<p>Shar, her friends called her. The name didn’t seem to fit with the girl’s aloof, royal air. It tasted strange in her mouth. She spent many afternoons among the humming machines of the upper deck, watching for Shar, eager for whatever pose she would grant.</p>
<p>Sometimes, she even managed to maneuver close, where she could sketch the girl’s exquisite complexion. A book full of studies of her lips and eyes and cheeks and ears evolved, without Fleurette even realizing how much work she was producing. She was still sketching the other girls occasionally, but mostly as a manner of comparison. Her favorite subjects had become this girl, the Captain of the Polite Request, and an older gentleman who fed the birds in the square every day. But to none of these other subjects did she devote as much time as to the black queen. For her, Fleurette laid in wait.</p>
<p>And so she was doing when Shar appeared at a communication mast. She leaned against it and watched the sun as it set among the clouds.</p>
<p>Then she began to sing.</p>
<p>It might have been that the song had words, but they were not words that Fleurette was familiar with. It hardly mattered. The mystifying song was the most enchanting thing the young Embless had ever heard. The dramatic notes haunted her and the words seem to describe some great loneliness. The power of the song was such that Fleurette could easily imagine the circumstances of the story. It was filled with lost love and aching empty sadness. Shar sang for ten minutes without pause. Fleurette was so enchanted by the echos of the song that she didn’t even notice Shar leave the deck and return inside.</p>
<p>Fleurette was left with an empty silence that seemed to reprise Shar’s lonely song. She looked down at her work and found that her careful strokes been smudged by several droplets that had seeped into the fine paper.Walking down the hallway to the little section of cafes and shops, Fleurette fell into step behind Shar. She followed her for no real reason, having left her sketchbook in the classroom. Curiosity, she supposed. It was a happy coincidence that they happen to be headed in the same direction for lunch. Quite suddenly, Shar spun about to confront Fleurette, who reeled back on her heels in shock. Shar placed her hands on her hips and slit her eyes imperiously down at the shorter girl.</p>
<p>“Can I help you with something?” She asked, more as a statement than a question.</p>
<p>“Ah,” Fleurette stumbled, unable to gain her composure.</p>
<p>Shar eyed the distance between them, meaningfully.</p>
<p>“Right, please don’t follow so closely behind me,” she said, turning.</p>
<p>“We were just wondering if you were going to get some lunch,” a familiar voice said behind Fleurette. Her friend from class, Cybeline peered cautiously from behind Fleurette’s smaller frame.</p>
<p>Shar stopped halfway, turning to look back at the two of them with a tilt to her head. Fleurette managed to look pensive, apologetic, and encouraging all at the same time, drawing a wry smile from Shar.</p>
<p>“Alright, sure. Any suggestions?” she said, gesturing for the other two to walk with her.</p>
<p>“I love that little bakery on the northwestern corner,” said Cybeline.</p>
<p>“I was thinking about crepes,” Shar said.</p>
<p>“I’ll eat whatever you two decide on. I’m just happy to eat with someone besides my own shadow,” Fleurette said.</p>
<p>“Me too,” Shar replied, causing the other two to shoot her looks of confusion. “I don’t have a lot of friends,” she said by way of explanation.Standing in line for crepes, Fleurette said, “How is it that you don’t have many friends? I see you with people all the time. You’re the epicenter of that entire little clique.”</p>
<p>“They’re not really friends. Do your parents have business partners? It’s kind of like that. They’re all trying to curry favor with me, as though it meant anything.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you a noble?” Cybeline asked, as impolitely as possible. She covered her hand with her mouth a moment later in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Well, yes, I’m a Countess—” their eyes went wide. The girl outranked even Fleurette’s noble mother. It was unheard of to speak with a countess this candidly. “What’s that look for?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said Fleurette.</p>
<p>“Aren’t we sort of overstepping ourselves having lunch with you at a common little crepe shop like this?” Cybeline asked. She was mortified at the prospect of a complete social disgrace.</p>
<p>“Maybe, I suppose, but we’ll just say that I hijacked your lunch, rather than the other way around. Is that fair?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” said Cybeline, still conflicted about this easy conversation with such a high ranking girl.</p>
<p>“You were saying, about your favor earlier, Shar?” Fleurette asked, as their food arrived. She peered over her crepe, bashful eyes magnified by her gold-rimmed glasses.</p>
<p>The noble couldn’t help but smile at the pensive and hesitant look but smile twisted wryly on her face as soon as it appeared. “Call me Charlotte, please. I can’t stand ‘Shar’ anymore. I was saying that my favor doesn’t account for very much. I really just inherited the title my mother had. She died giving birth to me, so there isn’t much of that left. My father’s into manufacturing, so we get by, but my title has never gotten us any special dispensation.”</p>
<p>“That’s awful,” said Cybeline.</p>
<p>“Truly awful,” echoed Fleurette, who was more haunted by the idea of not having a mother. A mechanic father who married into royalty resonated with her deeply.</p>
<p>Charlotte shook her head and put on another sardonic grin. “Honestly though, I don’t really care anymore. I’ve never had the power those girls think I have. I’m just tired of having deluded sycophants dogging my every step. Does that make any sense?”</p>
<p>Fleurette nodded encouragingly, willing her to continue. She listened in rapt attention, fascinated by the sound of Charlotte’s voice.</p>
<p>Cybeline prompted her, “Well, we certainly won’t be your deluded sycophants,” with a playful grin.</p>
<p>“That’s something at least.”</p>
<p>“Say, is there anything you’d like to do after classes finish today, Charlotte?” Fleurette asked, savoring the name on her tongue. It was quite a pleasant word.</p>
<p>“Yes, do tell. We should do something fun and interesting for once. Fleurette’s always stuck in her rooms doing remedial lessons.”</p>
<p>“They are not remedial,” she shot back, flushing with embarrassment. She tilted her head up, trying to produce some dignity. “I’m continuing my education in the mechanical arts. There’s still very much for me to learn.”</p>
<p>Charlotte laughed lightly, airily at their exchange. They noticed a certain kind of subtle longing in that laugh, reminding them how different her relationships were to theirs. “I’m not terribly busy. I have appointments for my own lessons after dinner though, so I’d better not stay out too late.”</p>
<p>“Well then, that will be a solid few hours, won’t it?” Cybeline calculated. “What shall we do with our time? Something interesting and exciting, mind you.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. I didn’t spend a lot of time off campus last year, I don’t really know what there is to do,” Fleurette said, momentarily considering the options.</p>
<p>“Oh, I have an idea, girls,” said Charlotte. “Its part of a lady’s education to spend time at the theater. I hear that there’s a wonderful drama going on right now.”</p>
<p>“What, you aren’t talking about The Queen of Dreams by Sapha?” Cybeline asked dismissively.</p>
<p>“I am,” Charlotte replied, unperturbed.</p>
<p>“You are not.”</p>
<p>“I am so,” Charlotte said, grinning at how childish the conversation had turned.</p>
<p>“It’s sold out! I’m certain of it! We can’t just find a seat on the opening week of the most talked about production in history!” she cried.</p>
<p>“I bet you this diamond bracelet that I can,” said Charlotte, dancing it in the sun at Cybeline.</p>
<p>“You! Ah- well... What would...” Cybeline started and stopped, her conviction evaporating as Charlotte folder her arms with a smug grin.</p>
<p>Fleurette clamped her hand over Cybeline’s mouth gently, beaming at Charlotte. “No bet,” she said, shaking Cybeline’s head with her hand.</p>
<p>“How will you find any tickets at all?” Cybeline asked as they get stood from the table, preparing to leave the cafe.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry about that,” she replied, fluttering a dismissive hand as her eyes sparkled with mischief.Only a few hours later, as classes ended and the students were dismissed, Fleurette and Cybeline turned to Charlotte, eyebrows raised in questioning looks. She hung her head. They smiled sadly to each other and stood to get ready to leave. Just then, Charlotte produced three silvery tickets apparently from thin air and her wicked grin returned. The others squealed and scampered over through the desks. She held up the tickets and fanned herself with them elaborately.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how you did it, but you’re a marvel,” Cybeline babbled. “I’ve been following this play for months! Its based on a true story, you know.”</p>
<p>“I guess you get to keep your bracelet,” Fleurette jibed, eliciting a giggle from Charlotte and relieved sigh from Cybeline.</p>
<p>Just then, the coven arrived. They arrayed themselves in a circle around Fleurette and Cybeline, physically excluding from Charlotte’s presence.</p>
<p>“Countess Shar, are these girls bothering you?”</p>
<p>“We can dispose of them if it would please you, my Lady.”</p>
<p>“Bourgeois trash,” hissed another.</p>
<p>Charlotte turned to their de facto leader, the senior girl with chopped, spiky hair. “Actually, Braelyn, why don’t you take the girls to go see a play?” she said. She tucked the tickets away and dragging Fleurette and Cybeline through the crowd by their dainty wrists.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Cybeline cried out and tumbled to the ground, spilling her books and papers everywhere. The toe of a stray shoe seemed to have made its way in front of her.</p>
<p>“Oh dear. What happened, Miss Albrecht? Have an accident?”</p>
<p>Charlotte stooped immediately to help Cybeline, glaring icily at the other girls. She opened her mouth to speak, but Fleurette darted between her friends and the black coven of witches.</p>
<p>“You all should probably get going,” she said, her voice firm. Years of Glorgox bullying strained her calm as she glared up at them imperiously.</p>
<p>“We may still have business here, little girl,” said their leader, stepping up to Fleurette. They stood toe to toe, the older girl towering over her. As she glowered down at the Embless, she tightened her grip around the handle of a thick black switch of the kind military officers use to discipline their troops. Behind her, the others stretched and flexed, ugly sneers beginning to surface at the thought of teaching Fleurette a lesson.</p>
<p>Charlotte hauled Cybeline to her feet, who started hurriedly stuffing her papers back into her bag. As they glanced back at the confrontation, Cybeline clutched at Charlotte’s hand in worry. Gathering her courage, Charlotte took a careful step towards the group, ready to try to break up the impending fight.</p>
<p>Instead, Fleurette withdrew a tiny spellgun from the small of her back.</p>
<p>“This device is called Rosethorn. I made it myself. I’m allowed to carry it for emergencies and defensive situations. Charlotte, does it seem like I might need to defend myself?”</p>
<p>A few moments passed as Braelyn struggled to maintain her impassive composure.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’ll be necessary, Mecanwaithe,” her spiky aggressor said, backing off several steps. She gathered her enforcers with a wave and strode from the room, sweat running down her pinched face.“I can not believe you stood up to them like that. I cannot believe it,” Cybeline repeated for the hundredth time since they arrived at the theater.</p>
<p>“Neither can I,” said Charlotte. “I’m so impressed, Fleurette. I’ve never been able to muster the courage to stand up to them like that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t blame you,” Cybeline said, her face clouded over. She pushed the three of them a little further along the line towards the box office.</p>
<p>“My goodness, you’re shaking all over!” Charlotte said, taking Fleurette’s hand. She hadn’t said a peep since the confrontation. Charlotte and Cybeline both smooshed her in a hug, shuffling along the line to the counter.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad you’re safe!” Cybeline said, squeezing her tighter.</p>
<p>“That was the most brave thing I’ve ever seen a girl do,” Charlotte said. Fleurette clung to the both of them and Charlotte had to awkwardly toss the tickets onto the counter for them to gain entry to the theater.</p>
<p>Once they were inside and walking to their seats, Charlotte asked, “Are you going to be okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m okay... It was just... I don’t know. I’m bad with situations like that. They make me crazy, like my heart is going to explode. I’ll be fine. I just need to relax for a bit.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Cybeline asked eventually, several flights of stairs later, but Charlotte maintained her conspiratorial silence.</p>
<p>“I figured the only seats in the house were probably here,” she said. She quietly pushed the door open to one of front box seating balconies.</p>
<p>The others stared, agape, unmoving.</p>
<p>“You’ll get used to it,” she said, pulling them inside to their seats.Cybeline’s room wasn’t that much different than the rooms of the other girls in the Finishing Academy. The wallpaper, the bed, the chairs, the closet, the dresser, and the vanity, they were all the same as everyone else’s. They looked rich and elegant, but not too expensive. The more affluent students disliked the conditions, claiming that they were inferior and unsophisticated. Cybeline liked the environment just fine; anything more would have been uncomfortably ostentatious.</p>
<p>She lay on her belly nestled between great mounds of covers, gazing at a handful of pictures. Some were glossy, printed using the chemical process. Others refracted the light, with images that shifted position as she turned them. The more expensive ones had been produced by magic and were quite rare.</p>
<p>She lay the four images out against her pillow to look at them. First among them was Charlotte’s shiny photo. The countess hadn’t been a very public sort of person before they met, but a few rare photos of her did exist. It seemed that they were all shot to portray her as a fragile beauty. There was something tragic about the way she smiled wistfully at the camera. Cybeline wondered what Charlotte had been thinking when they took the picture, or if someone had manipulated her expression beforehand.</p>
<p>Fleurette’s photo was one of the illusographs and had been given to her as a personal gift between friends. She smiled at the picture. There had always been something infectious about Fleurette’s beaming smile.</p>
<p>She clutched Eran’s grimy and worn picture, the only one she could find. She’d had to pry it out of a graduation book from the Iron Duke. There were little frays around the edge from wear. It would have been too forward of her to ask him for another, so she had to be careful from now on. She couldn’t keep his picture in her pocket anymore, or it would disintegrate.</p>
<p>Captain Salazar’s photo was another illusograph. His rakish, sly grin would have made her weak at the knees if she had been standing. Despite her feelings toward Eran, she could not deny that Captain Salazar was a fine specimen.</p>
<p>She rolled over, holding Fleurette next to Salazar in her hand, as though their pictures were one. She wondered how they would get along. Their images looked wonderful together; Fleurette’s playful smile and Salazar’s rakish smirk. They looked like they had shared a joke about some despicable leadership figure. She wondered how it would happen between them. Would Salazar make the first move? Would he even see Fleurette, or was her status beneath his notice?</p>
<p>She frowned.</p>
<p>Surely, if he chose not to whisk her away, she would go to him. Fleurette was self-empowered girl. She’d go out and lay her claim, wouldn’t she?</p>
<p>Cybeline looked at the photos again. The image of the two of them made her squeal. Her petite little Fleurette and that strong, wild heartthrob, the thought made her blush. It was any romantic girl’s dream.</p>
<p>Cybeline put the photos back down and picked up Eran’s. He wasn’t as dashing as Fleurette’s Lombard nor was he as cavalier or untamed as the Captain, but something about his gentle, boyish personality drove her wild. She blushed whenever she saw him. Even his tattered picture brought impure thoughts to her mind. She smiled up at his picture, as though he was there watching her. After a few minutes of fantasizing about their courtship, Cybeline rolled over again, kicking her legs. She pulled the last image from her pillow and gazed at it. Charlotte’s tragic character brought a frown to her face.</p>
<p>“Who will you be with?” she asked the mirage.</p>
<p>Standing up for herself and others, Fleurette quickly found, was not the path of peace aboard the Lady of Blades. She walked down the hall quickly, tugging her book bag along so that it wouldn’t keep slamming awkwardly into her thigh. Ahead of her, a cluster of girls gasped melodramatically to themselves as she passed. They whispered in hushed tones to each other, hiding their fingers as they pointed. She scurried past them, head held high.</p>
<p>She made her way downstairs to the cafeteria, where Charlotte and Cybeline were waiting for her. She’d wasted a good portion of her precious lunch break retrieving her forgotten sketchbook from the classroom. She was relieved that no one had found it, if they had, she’d probably have died of embarrassment.</p>
<p>In the line for lunch, she glanced over to Charlotte and Cybeline. They had already gotten their food and were sitting at a small table, but Charlotte’s adulators were busy suckering onto her. Fleurette’s friends looked tremendously uncomfortable. She wasn’t sure if sitting down at the table would make things better or worse.</p>
<p>She selected a number of small dishes and placed them on her tray as the girls around her kept wide distance. When her eyes flicked over to them, the older girl stepped between her friend and Fleurette in confrontational way, as though she had insulted them.</p>
<p>Fleurette ducked her head towards her tray and made her way across the cafeteria to her friends. Everyone she passed avoided her. She reached the cluster of darkly beautiful witches crowded around Charlotte and moved to set her tray down. Braelyn, their wild-looking leader gazed down at her accusingly.</p>
<p>“Oh, poor Countess Shar,” she said, her eyes cold. “Would you like us to fetch you something edible perhaps? Maybe something from your favorite crepe shop?” She hadn’t even looked at Charlotte as she spoke. Her icy stare was fixed on Fleurette.</p>
<p>“Braelyn, you must be hungry. Would you like to have a seat? In my lap perhaps, where you can feed me my own food?” Charlotte said, so sweetly Braelyn didn’t notice at first. She blushed when she realized what had been said.</p>
<p>“I’m just concerned about your nutrition, my lady. The school cafeteria hardly provides the proper sustenance for a countess.”</p>
<p>“Braelyn,” Charlotte said, using a rarely heard tone of command. “I don’t appreciate others looking down on me or my friends, literally or figuratively,” she said, looking up at the other girl. For a moment, she didn’t need to be taller to intimidate anyone.</p>
<p>Braelyn curtsied to Charlotte and led her retinue away. She stayed behind Charlotte’s back and made a rude gesture at Fleurette and Cybeline. Many of the students snickered and giggled, but Charlotte just rolled her eyes. She didn’t even have to look to know what had happened.</p>
<p>“The next time they pull something like that, I’ll start dictating a letter to my father about their behavior,” Charlotte grumbled, shoveling a bite of salad into her mouth in an unladylike fashion.“I’m really sorry I can’t go with you tonight,” Charlotte told Fleurette and Cybeline that evening. “You know that I really want to, but just I can’t. I have extra lessons to go to.”</p>
<p>Fleurette’s head hung sadly. “I know. I just hoped you might be able to squeeze out of your lessons for one day.”</p>
<p>Cybeline avoided eye contact with both of them. Her expression told Charlotte what she already knew, that Fleurette had wanted all three of them to enjoy the concert together.</p>
<p>Charlotte gave them both a hug. “You know how it is for me. You two will just have to go to the concert and enjoy it for me,” she sighed.</p>
<p>“Well, try not to die of boredom,” Cybeline said, leading Fleurette towards the doors of the auditorium. Charlotte watched her friends walk dejectedly up the stairs and almost ran up after them, damn the lessons. But the lessons she had to attend were not the sort of thing she could ignore. There would be repercussions.</p>
<p>Once Fleurette and Cybeline were inside the auditorium, Charlotte turned the other way and walked in the direction of the embassies. She kept her head held high and avoided major thoroughfares, hoping not to attract attention. She made her way across the fancy decks of the Lady of Blades to the darkly mysterious embassy of the Maw of Noxura. The guards out front recognized her and let her through without so much as making eye contact.</p>
<p>Once inside, Charlotte walked politely down the hall past several offices. She took the stairwell at the end and made her way up to the top floor of the compact building. By now, she was sweating with anxiety. She slowly crept down the last hall to an inconspicuous room marked with a small sign that read, “storage.”</p>
<p>Inside was a gentle-looking man with a congenial smile. He sat at an old collapsible desk with a stack of papers and an elegant fountain pen. Around him, various metal cases and wooden crates were stacked. In the corner, there was a medical shroud with a cold metal stool and some other equipment behind it.</p>
<p>“Good evening, Miss Charlotte,” the doctor said. He motioned behind the stool and turned politely as she started unbuttoning her bodice.Cybeline was in high spirits the next morning. Charlotte was not. Fleurette noticed the stark contrast in their demeanors as soon as they entered the classroom. Cybeline tried not to skip to her desk, bobbing with joy. Her short brunette hair seemed to sway and flip with a mind of its own. She had to hold herself down to her seat to keep from floating away. Charlotte’s lifeless, anesthetic stare barely even slid over the perplexed faces of her friends as she sat down. With the practiced, mechanical grace of a well-studied lady, she gently swept her own dark hair back over her chair and sat still, waiting for class. Cybeline blinked at Fleurette who returned her concerned look.</p>
<p>“You alright, this morning?” she asked Charlotte. “You look unwell.”</p>
<p>Charlotte turned to her distractedly. Her violet eyes were distant. She blinked a few times as though she were returning from some daydream. “I’m sorry? I’m sorry, I was off in the north, I guess. Did you say something?”</p>
<p>“Way up north,” Cybeline confirmed.</p>
<p>“We asked if you’re alright. You look pale as a sheet,” Fleurette said.</p>
<p>“I’m alright,” she said, shaking her head. “My lessons went long last night. I was up late.”</p>
<p>Satisfied with that answer, Cybeline piped up, “I was up late last night, myself.” She looked smug. The others looked at her with interest.</p>
<p>“Well?” Charlotte prompted.</p>
<p>“I got a letter.”</p>
<p>“From who?” Fleurette asked, confused. Neither she nor Charlotte knew what she was so excited about.</p>
<p>“I sent a letter back to the Dragoon. To a boy.”</p>
<p>“What boy?” Charlotte asked in sisterly disapproval.</p>
<p>“There’s a boy?” Fleurette squeaked in a whisper.</p>
<p>Cybeline leaned in close to her co-conspirators. “His name is Eran. He’s a soldier on the Dragoon. He’s so brave and charming and oh, I could just… Well. He and I met right after the picker invasion on the twenty-seventh of Flame. He was wounded in the fighting and I happened to be on duty in sick bay that day.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you say something before?” Fleurette hissed. The other girls of the class were starting to filter in, and she didn’t want to attract more attention than they already had.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to get my hopes up. I told him I had I was going to school aboard the Lady and that I would write, but he never really assured me that he’d write back. He just finished his tour on the Iron Duke.”</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s pretty young,” Charlotte said. The typical custom was for men to marry women five to eight years younger than themselves. If Cybeline’s admirer graduated in the last class, he’d only be a couple years older than them at the most.</p>
<p>Cybeline squeezed her hands together with a bashful look. “I hope he doesn’t decide to wait,” she said. “I couldn’t stand it if I knew someone else got him.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Fleurette said. “Who pays attention to tradition these days anyway?”As soon as Miss Mathusus left the room, Cybeline turned to Fleurette. “Tell me how it’s going with your friend, that Graf. I need tips. I’ve got to write another letter tonight!”</p>
<p>Fleurette’s mouth popped open as a blush spread across her face. She curled into a ball in her chair, as though she could wriggle away from the question. Charlotte arrived a moment later with an arched eyebrow, her school things packed into her bag already.</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard about this Graf,” Charlotte said with a bit of a pout. She looked back and forth between the other two, using chagrin to hide her anxiety.</p>
<p>“Well, you know, it’s natural for emblems and emblesses to start courting early,” Fleurette said, studying her knees.</p>
<p>“Don’t let her fool you, she’s head over heels for this guy. What’s his name again? Kitharon?” Cybeline boasted.</p>
<p>Fleurette’s sheepish eyes peeked up at Charlotte. Her nervous smile was apologetic.</p>
<p>“We’re— we’re not really courting, it’s more like we’re good friends,” she said defensively. “We don’t really get to spend that much time together. It’s almost like having another brother.”</p>
<p>“Ouch! Poor chap,” Cybeline said. Charlotte giggled quietly.</p>
<p>“It’s not like that— Oh… He’s just… I don’t know…” Fleurette said, trying to focus on the task of putting her own supplies away. “It’s hard to explain. We’ve never really talked about s-seeing each other… people just sort of assumed, I guess. It’s not like I don’t like him… He’s just fun to talk to, you know? We joke and play pranks on each other, that sort of thing.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like what the boys do on the Iron Duke. Hassle each other constantly, even though they don’t mean it. They say it builds character,” Cybeline said, packing away her school things and stroking the letter.</p>
<p>“I think my character is plenty well built already,” Charlotte said as haughtily as she could, her nose in the air. The other two snickered at her impersonation. “But it sounds to me like Fleurette doth protest too much. Maybe she’s actually is sweet on this Graf.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m telling you,” Cybeline replied, nodding a knowing look at Charlotte.</p>
<p>“Why is it that a boy and a girl can’t consort without it being romantic?” Fleurette pouted, her shoulders drawn together over her book bag.</p>
<p>Cybeline looked baffled, “My gods, Fleurette. Don’t you have a romantic bone in your body? This is what good society girls do! Right Charlotte?”</p>
<p>“Uhh, yeah, yep!”</p>
<p>Fleurette hung her head. “I know I’m not much of a noble, but I still feel like... I don’t know… like the rules of society are too stuffy.”</p>
<p>Cybeline put her hands on her hips. “They’re there to prevent anarchy from destroying the Fleet, Fleurette. Imagine what things would be like if people could just do whatever they wanted. Would anyone work the farming platforms? Would anyone clean the rooms and streets?” Cybeline continued.</p>
<p>“I suppose not,” Fleurette said, backing out of the conversation with a conciliatory shake of her head. Cybeline huffed, peering at Fleurette curiously.</p>
<p>“Well, this has been lovely, but I’m going to go write to that boy,” Cybeline said abruptly.</p>
<p>“Good luck,” Charlotte said, elbowing her.</p>
<p>“Don’t be too polite,” Fleurette mumbled. She and Charlotte gathered their remaining things as Cybeline trotted out into the hallway with glee.</p>
<p>“So what do you think? Think they’ll start courting for real?” Fleurette asked.</p>
<p>They walked out of the room together, pondering Cybeline’s new relationship. The time she’d been spending away from them was starting to make a little more sense now that they knew what she was up to.</p>
<p>Charlotte tapped a finger to her lips. “I’m not sure. You’ve known her longer. Does she do this often?”</p>
<p>“About once every couple of months,” she said, allowing herself a little snicker.</p>
<p>“There’s your answer, then,” Charlotte said as they round the corner into the crowded hall.The herd of other girls flushed them along the corridors and out into the Finishing Academy. They detoured to their favorite spot to relax, a tiny little glassed-in garden on the corner of one of the streets just outside the campus gates.</p>
<p>They entered the little rose garden quietly despite the fact that no one was ever there. The glass walls were held together with ancient brass that had been polished with centuries of careful cleaning. The rich carpet of grass in the middle of the garden was just big enough for three or four adults to sit together, the perfect size for the girls’ after school relaxations. The air was thick with the scent of flowers and was a welcome relief from the mild chill of the main spaces of the ship.</p>
<p>Fleurette carefully placed her worn leather book bag onto the soft grass and did her best impression of a noble lady. Daintily, she folding her long red skirt at the knee and neatly levered herself down onto the soft green. Charlotte performed a perfect impression of a young commoner by belling her skirt and dropping unceremoniously to the ground. They laughed at each others impressions and reclined together in the moist air of the rose garden.</p>
<p>“Can I draw you again today?” Fleurette asked.</p>
<p>“If you must. I do need to study a bit, miss I-know-everything-in-the-curriculum-already. Make sure you get my good side,” She said, grinning wryly.</p>
<p>“It’s not exactly as though you have a bad side,” Fleurette said, turning away for a moment, and covering the motion by fetching her bookbag and drawing supplies.</p>
<p>“Why do you like to draw me so much, anyway?”</p>
<p>“I draw other people, too,” Fleurette pouted defensively.</p>
<p>“That’s not an answer.”</p>
<p>She shrugged, too flustered to speak speak honestly for a long moment. “Its like drawing a rose. You always want to draw the prettiest rose, so if you have a garden, you end up drawing the same rose over and over until it’s gone.”</p>
<p>“I think that may have been the nicest compliment I’ve ever gotten,” Charlotte said, her face flushed. She studied her hands in her lap.</p>
<p>“That pose. Hold that,” Fleurette demanded, eyeballing her and scribbling furiously onto her paper.</p>
<p>She sighed. “Can I get my book first?”</p>
<p>“I guess, so long as you don’t move at all,” Fleurette said, already measuring her with her pencil.</p>
<p>Charlotte squirmed to grab her textbook, laughing that perfect, melodic laugh and Fleurette furiously scritched it onto the corner of her page.</p>
<p>“You sure take your drawing seriously. Almost as seriously as your studies.” Fleurette didn’t reply, her concentration locked on her drawing. Charlotte couldn’t help but grin at her knitted brows and flickering eyes.</p>
<p>“...Such a pretty smile,” Fleurette mumbled as she continued to try to capture the blush spreading across Charlotte’s lovely features.</p>
<p>A beat passed.</p>
<p>Then another.</p>
<p>Then she clamped her hands over her mouth. “Oh my goodness, I’m sorry, oh bloody Crown, I’m so embarrassed.” She curled up into a ball around her drawing. “I didn’t even realize I said it.”</p>
<p>Charlotte fidgeted on the bright grass. “You’re doing a fine job with the compliments today.”</p>
<p>An awkward silence stretched out between them like a cat in the sun. Charlotte dove back into her textbook and Fleurette eventually continued her sketching. Every few minutes they caught each other smiling back timidly.Meanwhile, aboard the Clockwork Dragoon, the subject of a previous conversation arrived at his destination. Lombard cast a furtive glance over his shoulder again, checking the corridor for other people. He drew the gold leafed envelope from the breast pocket of his elaborately detailed military dress uniform, just in case he needed an alibi. Working the knob a bit, he managed to force his way inside with a quiet spell of unlocking. He let himself inside quickly and closed the door behind himself.</p>
<p>Inside, the generously decorated room was unexpectedly small. The high ceiling masked the tightness of the tapestry covered walls. The chests and tables and bed frame were all wrought in a deep, rich wood that must have been hundreds of years old. There were still a few stray items of clothing in strewn across the bed, drawing his attention momentarily from the task at hand. He crossed to the bed, taking one of the garments in his hand, a small thing. Belatedly, he realized he was handling Fleurette’s undergarments. He ran the fabric between his fingers, enjoying the sensation of the smooth silk and letting his mind wander. He dropped it back onto the bed in roughly the same place it was before.</p>
<p>Crossing to the dresser, he quickly looked for anything small that might appease the elders. He was hoping for some kind of trinket, something she might have experimented with. Something advanced that they haven’t seen before. He found nothing there except gears and sprockets amongst the pictures of her family.</p>
<p>He moved to the closet, saving the workbench for last. He reasoned that she was likely to keep the more important things hidden, rather than out in the open. He opened the closet door quietly, employing an unusual amount of skill in stealth as he rifled through her belongings. He checked the cases and tubes and boxes, but again came up with essentially nothing that would help.</p>
<p>Lombard moved to the workbench. He needed to find something useful, or else he would be in a fair amount of hot water with his superiors, not to mention the danger it would put Fleurette in.</p>
<p>There’s got to be something, he thought.</p>
<p>He checked the objects on the top; all just components and bits, half assembled, nothing new. He opened the main drawer, finding it full of papers and drawings and sketches. Some of them were portraits or still-life works but most are construction drawings and component diagrams. He stuffed the lot into a bag. I’ll sort them later, he decided. Drawings were good, but he needed something concrete. He needed an artifact, an object of some kind of advanced technology. If he couldn’t prove her worth, the elders would not see fit to keep her around after things changed.</p>
<p>He broke open one drawer in hopes of finding such an artifact. Inside he found a toolbox full of expensive instruments and delicate devices but nothing of her own construction. There were some other parts at the bottom but they were mostly measuring contraptions. He broke open the last drawer. His desperation was growing. Rummaging through it, he found a number of small batteries, only a few of which looked even remotely promising. He pulled out a couple of cheat-sheet cards for math and physics and discarded them after a cursory inspection. Below that he came across two books. The first was a family album that he flipped through hoping for more clues. The other one was a mindworker’s learning tome she had filled up when she was in school here on the Dragoon. He dropped them both back in the desk and collapsed in the chair. After a moment, he dug the tome back out and shoved it back into his bag. In doing so, he noticed something under her desk.</p>
<p>He reached under and dragged out a narrow object about the size of a large book. The scaly hide-bound case had brass bindings and fittings, and a sturdy looking lock on it. On the front of the case were embossed the words “Rosethorn &amp; Lotus.”</p>
<p>A grin spread across his face. Jackpot.Fleurette entered her classroom with some trepidation, as she always did. The door to the room was little more than a sliding panel and the walls nothing but modular sections that could be moved and changed, but they always kept the room layout the same. Year after year, it had been the tradition aboard the Lady of Blades to have the door to the classrooms close to the front, where the teacher could see everyone that entered late. For Fleurette, it meant that every morning was a confrontation.</p>
<p>She’d taken to coming in earlier and earlier, to avoid as many of the other students as possible. The fewer of them there were, the less likely they were to bully or harass her.</p>
<p>That day, as she entered the classroom, there were only a couple of students sitting at their desks. Fleurette crossed the room to her seat, keeping an eye on them, just in case, but they didn’t laugh or comment or snicker at her. They noted her presence and went back to their discussion.</p>
<p>Fleurette’s heart leapt. They had noticed her but they had decided that teasing her wasn’t worth the trouble. It was a crowning achievement. After a moment of thinking about it, Fleurette’s triumph soured into depression. Why should I live a life where my primary desire is to be ignored? she asked herself. What kind of dream is that for me to have?</p>
<p>She sat in alternating relief and despondency and waited for her friends to arrive. More students trickled in. They displayed varying degrees of interest in her, from none at all to bored disdain. For the most part, the class’s hatred of her had cooled significantly over the two weeks since her first encounter with Braelyn. She supposed that she hadn’t angered enough of the other students for Braelyn’s animosity to infect them. After long enough, they stopped caring.</p>
<p>Cybeline came in just before Miss Mathusus called the class to order. Charlotte hadn’t shown up yet. As the teacher took roll, Charlotte stepped in, out of breath. Miss Mathusus stared at her coolly down the bridge of her beak-like nose. There was a tense moment where the students were unsure who would budge first. The teacher had to uphold the order of the class, but Charlotte was a countess, not someone to be talked down to.</p>
<p>“Pardon my lateness,” Charlotte said after a pause. She gave a polite curtsy and made her penitent way to her desk, thus avoiding the social conundrum. Miss Mathusus was so awed at the countess’s deference and manners that she forgot to mark Charlotte’s name at all.</p>
<p>“Well then, ladies. As you know, the Lord’s Dance is coming up in a week. In preparation for the dance, we will be changing the schedule of classes. Starting today and going until Niday, the fourth of Lord, we will gather in the afternoon for dance lessons. They will take place from three until five each day. Please be sure to dress properly before arriving at the ballroom.”</p>
<p>The room was aflutter with excited whispers.</p>
<p>“We will be dividing ourselves into groups of no fewer than three, and no greater than five. Please find appropriate companions after class,” Miss Mathusus said, over the chattering girls. Charlotte, Fleurette, and Cybeline smiled at each other. Their group was already decided.Fleurette, Cybeline and Charlotte were sitting in rickety old chairs in the Grand Ballroom of the Lady of Blades where the dances were always held. Having just finished their turn at practice, they slumped, tired but happy, into their seats to chat between clusters of other girls.</p>
<p>“So why did you come over to the Lady early Cybeline?” Charlotte asked.</p>
<p>“Well, to be perfectly honest, my parents thought I needed rather more finishing than usual. I’m a bit more boisterous than my older sisters, so they just sent me on ahead a little earlier so I could try to attain some measure of grace before I embarrass myself in front of the throngs of other students.”</p>
<p>“That’s sort of harsh, isn’t it?” Fleurette asked.</p>
<p>“Well, I also looked at is as a chance to come and make more friends.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you weren’t playing hard to get with the Boy?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, because fleeing to completely different ship is an excellent way to gain a suitor’s interest,” Cybeline said. “If anything, that would have been my parents’ plan. More likely, they thought that a few more weeks aboard the Lady would imbue me with the manners of an Imperial princess. ‘Oh, that you were more like your sisters,’ they always say.”</p>
<p>“Are your sisters really that much more cultured?” Fleurette asked, her brows knitting together as she tried to recall the few times they had met.</p>
<p>“Enough that they both found nice husbands off the Dragoon by the time they were seventeen.”</p>
<p>“That’s only a year away...” Fleurette said in awe.</p>
<p>“Speak for yourself,” Charlotte said under her breath, eyes flicking elsewhere.</p>
<p>“My mother’s probably right thought. They’re the nicest people I know; Erinaal, the oldest, always brings me sweets all the way from the Favor of Baeus when she visits. Peraline likes to send me fliers from the Emperor’s Watchdog about the latest fashions and trends and so on.”</p>
<p>“Is it hard on your family to only have daughters?” Charlotte asked.</p>
<p>“It was, but they’ve gotten over the issue at this point. The Albrecht family name won’t be around much longer anyway since I don’t have any uncles with boys either. Mother and father are still trying, but our physician doesn’t think its likely at this point.”</p>
<p>“What about you, Fleurette?” Charlotte asked, turning to her. “You mentioned brothers and sisters in class the other day. What’s your family like?”</p>
<p>There was an awkward, pregnant pause.</p>
<p>“Fleurette’s blessed with a wonderful family,” Cybeline interjected haltingly.</p>
<p>Fleurette struggled to frame her answer without bringing politics into it, but it proved impossible. “My mother is a— was. Was a Duchess. When my parents married, the House was powerful enough that it could grant the title of Embless. They gave it to me on my tenth birthday, but I haven’t really been able to help the family much. We’ve sort of fallen on hard times,” she said, hanging her head in shame. She picked her self up quickly though. “But I have four wonderful little siblings. I have two little brothers and two little sisters. They’re all just so adorable!”</p>
<p>The three of them sat for a moment, each searching for a way to ease the tension.</p>
<p>“How old are they?” Charlotte prompted, tugging an awkward smile into place.</p>
<p>“Well, they go boy-girl-boy-girl, and the oldest after me is thirteen now. The next is eleven, then nine, then seven.”</p>
<p>“That’s a pretty tight spread. You’re only sixteen right? That’s almost one every other year.”</p>
<p>“My mother and father love each other very much,” she said, casting her eyes up and and away at the innuendo.</p>
<p>“And fairly often,” Cybeline said, clapping Fleurette on the shoulder. The three of them burst out laughing.</p>
<p>The tension was easing off, finally. Still laughing, Fleurette continued the joke, “Yes, what we Mecanwaithes lack in power we make up for in numbers,” eliciting more gales of laughter.</p>
<p>After the giggles subsided and the glares of the surrounding girls had been successfully ignored, the conversation started back up again.</p>
<p>“What about you, Charlotte? What’s your family like?” Cybeline asked. Both she and Fleurette were anxious to hear this; not only were they interested, but they had recently realized that they never found out her actual family name. All they knew was that she was referred to as Countess Charlotte in class on the rare occasions that a teacher actually had the nerve to call on her. They were hoping the conversation would prompt her to bring up her family name at least once, which was all they needed to avoid a deep etiquette pitfall.</p>
<p>“I’m an only child. I live with my father. My mother died in childbirth, but my father tells me that I had an older brother when I was very little. I don’t remember him though, since he died when I was young, too.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry we’re bringing up all this tragedy, Charlotte,” Cybeline said, giving her a hug.</p>
<p>“Its alright. We Glorgoxes are tough.”</p>
<p>Fleurette stopped. She stared across the chairs at Charlotte.</p>
<p>“What? What’s the matter, Fleurette?” Cybeline asked innocently.</p>
<p>“House Mecanwaithe was deposed from leadership of the Clockwork Dragoon almost four years ago. Captain Ra-Nydor was installed immediately. His lone supporter was House Glorgox,” Fleurette said, her voice more quiet than a wing-beat.</p>
<p>Charlotte suddenly looked at her, stunned. She opened her mouth several times to speak but couldn’t seem to find the words. Tears welled up in her eyes, mirroring Fleurette’s.</p>
<p>“Bloody Crown. Umm...” stumbled Cybeline.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know... My father... he doesn’t talk much about his work,” Charlotte mumbled in apology.</p>
<p>“It’s alright...” Fleurette said, but everyone knew it wasn’t.Charlotte was early to class the next morning. She waited by Fleurette’s desk anxiously, fiddling with her hair. Cybeline came in, just before Miss Mathusus, and flashed Charlotte a brief, apologetic smile. Charlotte took her seat as class began, and Fleurette hurried in late. She couldn’t make eye contact with Charlotte the entire day.</p>
<p>By lunch of the next day, Charlotte’s apprehension had turned to despair.</p>
<p>“I said I’m sorry, Fleurette,” she whispered. She looked up after a moment, but Fleurette hadn’t heard her over the din of the other students in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>That afternoon, after classes ended, Fleurette got up to leave slowly. Cybeline turned to Charlotte to prompt her, but she sat motionless. After Fleurette left, Cybeline knelt down next to Charlotte.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Charlotte. It’s probably pretty hard for her to accept. I’m sure it is for you too, but she’s had a rough time the last few years.”</p>
<p>“What happened to make her hate me so much?” Charlotte asked, despondent and lonely.</p>
<p>“She doesn’t hate you,” Cybeline said, hugging Charlotte. “It just, she was raised her whole life to be a symbol of pride for the Dragoon. Four years ago, when Councilman Mecanwaithe was stripped of his rank, it hit the family hard. Without him as the captain, the ship’s been steadily declining, along with the House. They blame House Glorgox because of the Margrave’s involvement in the fall of Mecanwaithe and the Dragoon.</p>
<p>“It’s been especially hard on Fleurette because she’s her House’s embless. They expected a lot of great things from her, but now the House is in such disarray that it doesn’t look like anyone can salvage it, even her. Now it looks like she’ll have to marry a rich noble just to keep the House and the ship afloat.”</p>
<p>“I can’t help what my father did,” Charlotte begged. The few remaining students averted their eyes at her shameful display of emotion.</p>
<p>Cybeline wrapped Charlotte in a hug. “I know. Don’t worry, Charlotte, she’s a smart girl. She’ll get over it. She knows it’s not your fault. She’s just trying to make sense of everything. We have to give her a little time.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s been lonely for me too,” Charlotte said. She tightened her face and wiped her tears away. “I know what it’s like to be lonely. So I’ll be here for her whenever she needs me.”</p>
<p>Cybeline gave her a squeeze and helped her pack her things. “She’ll be back to normal soon. I know it.”Danger snapped Fleurette back into reality. The coven was arrayed around her desk. All the other students had left, and the sunset was waning through the windows, casting dangerous raking shadows across the girls faces.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” she said, more weary than vehement.</p>
<p>“You’re out of favor.”</p>
<p>“Something happen, little Mecanwaithe?”</p>
<p>“It appears that you’re no longer needed in the Countess’s presence,” said the leader.</p>
<p>She tried to appear strong but her head drooped as she contemplated the betrayal.</p>
<p>“Charlotte said that?” she asked, quiet as a mouse.</p>
<p>“How dare you use her given name so casually,” grumbled one girl.</p>
<p>“She did say that,” said the leader, standing over her with a victorious leer.</p>
<p>“She said she was disappointed in you.”</p>
<p>“Or was it disgusted?” said another, and they giggled darkly.</p>
<p>“Well, anyway, it’s a good thing the mighty House Glorgox is helping out on the Dragoon, seeing as its under siege again.”</p>
<p>“It’s what?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you didn’t know? What a bad girl, paying not attention to her home-ship. Don’t worry, the Countess’s father, Typhon, will save the day, just for you.”</p>
<p>“The Dragoon is under attack?” Fleurette asked again, her heart stone-still in her chest.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear me?”</p>
<p>She stood from her desk, bolt upright, and grabbed her books. She made to push between the girls.</p>
<p>They stripped her bag from her and the contents spilled onto the floor. The strap caught around her wrist and she twisted free, giving up on her belongings. The engine. I need to get to a radio, she thought wildly.</p>
<p>The first blow was a sudden explosion of pain across her back. The next struck her square between her petite shoulder blades and dropped her akimbo across a desktop. Sucking in a breath of pain, she struggled to get upright, still intent on escaping to a radio, but an unkind hand pushed her off the desk and onto the floor. She scrambled across the floor, trying desperately. The sound of harsh laughter grated behind her like so many steel traps.</p>
<p>She managed to get into a crouch and stumbled down the aisles towards the front of the classroom. Something caught her in the side, making a fluttering sound and landing with a heavy thud. She glanced down as she made her way between the desks and realized distantly that they were throwing her scattered books back at her. She ducked to take cover behind the desks, but another text cracked against her head, loosening her hair with cry of pain and frustration. She staggered for the door, taking the spine of another book in the soft part of her neck before escaping the harpies in the classroom. Once around the door frame, she took off at a dead sprint down the hallway.The nurse gave up on trying to correctly bandage the wound on Fleurette’s neck. She kept turning her head, desperately intent on devising some new weapon or device that might help the soldiers of the Dragoon. She scribbled and jotted furiously, running through reams of paper and scrapping ideas as fast as they came, waving off the nurse occasionally when her work interfered with her frenzied annotations.</p>
<p>The nurse applied a cold salve to her neck, instantly causing Fleurette to jerk and round on her.</p>
<p>“Knock it off! Can’t you see I’m busy!” she seethed at the innocent nurse. “This thing is already enough!” she said, gripping the bandage applied to her head. Her hair was a mess, but the valiant nurse had at least managed to clean the blood out of her long golden corkscrews and fit a bandage over the laceration.</p>
<p>The nurse paused for a moment but held her ground. She could see more wounds since she managed to pull Fleurette out of her dress before she got to work at her desk. The nurse began devising a plan to apply the bruise salve to her limbs, but there was a knock at the door before she could continue her work.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, cracking the door to see who it is.</p>
<p>“It’s Solbus Ilorgan. I’m her tutor. Let me in.”</p>
<p>“Master Ilorgan, the Embless isn’t decent at the moment.”</p>
<p>“She’s wounded. I need to speak with her. Now.”</p>
<p>“Let him in,” Fleurette said without looking up.</p>
<p>Ilorgan lumbered in, brushing past the pale nurse to get a look at the damage. Fleurette’s petite form was seated at her desk, her narrow limbs displaying ugly mauve bruises in strange shapes. She had a great wad of blood-dyed fabric strapped to her head with long loops of white bandage. Her waist-length curls were bundled up in a great misfortune that was pinned to the side of her head. With her hair out of the way, Solbus could see two vast wounds on her back, not unlike those from a military cudgel.</p>
<p>“By the Emperor, what the hell happened to you?” he hissed.</p>
<p>“Help me. The Dragoon is in trouble.”</p>
<p>“Ah, so you’ve… heard. About that.”</p>
<p>“Don’t give me that! I had to hear it from a coven of witches at school! Why wasn’t I told?” she screamed.</p>
<p>“Your father didn’t want you doing something rash. He radioed and made me swear to keep it a secret until the battle was over.”</p>
<p>“You should have told him it’d never work. Hurry up and help me.”</p>
<p>“With what? What are you doing?” he asked in resignation as he walked over. He tried to stay out of the way of the nurse who went back to her own work on Fleurette.</p>
<p>“It’s my fault. I never told anyone. I didn’t think the Dragoon would be besieged so soon after the last time, but now I’m out of time.”</p>
<p>“What’s going on, Fleurette?”</p>
<p>“Father sent me down to clean under the spellworks. I ended up checking on the engine when I was there, and it was corroded. The containment system is starting to fail, Master.”</p>
<p>Solbus’s face was a mixture of surprise and dismay. “Why didn’t you tell anyone?”</p>
<p>“There’s only one thing to do. We have to rebuild the containment system.”</p>
<p>“But there’s nowhere to set down for hundreds of kilometers!”</p>
<p>“That’s why we have to do it in the air.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“There’s no time. I have an idea, but I need several large capacitors and the equipment and materials build a new containment shell.”</p>
<p>“You’re really thinking of doing this? You really think you can take the artifact out of containment, put it in a new shell, and hook it back up without losing power while in flight and under siege?”</p>
<p>“I know I can, but I could use some help. Any ideas?”</p>
<p>“How about a bridge crew that knows what they’re doing,” he said, unable to look at the preposterous situation in anything but a whimsical light.</p>
<p>“I can’t manufacture that here. And if I did, it’d never go into production in this climate.”</p>
<p>“You’re becoming quite the cynic, my dear Embless.”</p>
<p>“Not a lot has happened to give me reason otherwise, Master Ilorgan. If you’re not going to help, then clear out. The nurse is annoying enough.”</p>
<p>“Shining Crown, be nice to her girl, she’s taking care of you. You should see yourself.”</p>
<p>Fleurette sighed and put her pencil down. She turned to the nurse, “Thank you for your service. I’ll let you finish in a moment.” She turned to Ilorgan who was on his way to the door. “Master Ilorgan, I have a request.”</p>
<p>He knew what was coming. Head hung, he sighed. “Do tell,” he said in resignation.</p>
<p>“I need the third case.”</p>
<p>“The heavy one?” he asked, rubbing his face.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ll also be needing some space to work on the new equipment.”</p>
<p>“I’ll get it done. Move some walls over in our workshop, if I have to. Will that suffice?”</p>
<p>“If you can get it done in a few minutes.”</p>
<p>“I’ll see what I can do…”The two of them stood before a large case with thick bumpers and heavy locks all around it. It looked to be the type that could hinge completely flat if one separates all the panels, and it was big enough to fit several people inside it. They stared at it, Fleurette cradling a bundle of drawings and diagrams and Ilorgan holding a massive toolbox full of prototyping equipment. He brushed some dust off his ruddy old uniform absentmindedly.</p>
<p>“Can I at least see it this time? You’re always so secretive with it.”</p>
<p>“I have to be. Can you imagine what would happen if the Glorgoxes...” she trailed off, Charlotte’s heartbreaking face appearing in her mind.</p>
<p>“Yes, well, there’s no chance of anyone else interfering with your work now; I had the surrounding rooms cleared out for you. We’re locked off.”</p>
<p>“I suppose you’ll be a great asset to me while I work.”</p>
<p>“Asset. Pshh. I’ve been doing this work for twice as long as you’ve been alive, girl.”</p>
<p>“Lets get started then.”</p>
<p>Fleurette walked to the case and took a magical key to the main lock. Glyphs dissipated and the complex framework of chains and locks began to open. The case, standing taller than a man, collapsed around its contents with a clatter.</p>
<p>The machine sat curled up into a fetal position, an exoskeleton of hydraulically articulated armor plates. She walked around it, inspecting for damage and removing fail-safe pins and shear latches. She reached the other side and fiddled with the power source as Ilorgan stepped forward in awe to examine the piece of equipment.</p>
<p>“This is what you call a rapid prototyping machine? This… this is a suit!”</p>
<p>“It can lift a ton and a half easy, and it can move every joint with mechanical precision. I designed it to make it easier to fabricate parts. I call it a servosuit.”</p>
<p>“For the servo-motors. I see. Ingenuous...”</p>
<p>Fleurette powered up the generator and peered around the massive brass arm with a slight smirk. “Close your mouth, you’re drooling.”</p>
<p>He blinked and glanced at her and suddenly burst into laughter. “Aha. Yep. That’s the girl I know.”Fleurette was fortunate that Master Ilorgan was a very prepared man. It turned out that he had most of the equipment and materials she needed on hand; with the walls down, the workspace looked like he’d been prepared for her to start a factory aboard the Lady of Blades. She just hoped he had enough magesteel for the entire enclosure, otherwise she’d be in trouble.</p>
<p>The first order of business was to finish her design for the new containment system. She sat at Ilorgan’s drafting table and spread her papers, her hands shaking with the uneasy knowledge that her family’s lives could be at stake. Solbus stood by her shoulder, piecing the equipment together in his mind.</p>
<p>“This isn’t going to be easy…” he said, trying to hide his dismay.</p>
<p>“We can do it. It’s possible. And I can’t just sit around and wait for something to go wrong.”</p>
<p>“What if something goes wrong because of the upgrade?”</p>
<p>“That kind of thinking is exactly why I never brought it up to anyone. But Master Ilorgan, it’s not impossible. It shouldn’t even really be that hard. In essence, all we need to do is charge a capacitor block with enough energy to keep the ship going for a bit, swap the artifact out of the old engine and into the new one, and plug it all back in. We do this sort of thing all the time with mission-critical hardware, and we do it well.”</p>
<p>“The main engine is a little more than mission critical…”</p>
<p>“That’s exactly why we can’t wait for it to fail. Look at it this way, either we wait for the containment to fail, resulting in either an uncontrolled descent or a tremendous explosion, or we replace it before that happens, and give ourselves a chance of that not happening.”</p>
<p>Solbus looked unconvinced for a moment. “How bad was the magesteel corrosion on the shell?”</p>
<p>“We don’t have time for this, Master. If there was any corrosion at all, that means the containment is not one hundred percent effective, and that means that it’s in the process of failing. The risk of waiting is exponential.”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright. But even if we get the shell built, there’s no guarantee that they’ll let you install it.”</p>
<p>“We’ll deal with that when we get there.” Fleurette threw herself back at the drawings, referring back and forth between original plans and her new design. She wasn’t trying to reinvent the wheel, but she wanted to make sure that there was room for improvement. She designed the system to have multiple layers, each with its own set of sensors, so they’d have better warning about leaks in the future. She took careful notes and measurements so that they’d be able to reuse the existing control console; that was a piece of equipment too complex and fine-tuned to rebuild. Instead, she made sure that all the sensor connections and controls would fit into the new containment shell.</p>
<p>Within a half hour, Ilorgan was assembling materials as Fleurette started up the suit. She stepped carefully, making sure not to jostle the compartment too much as she carried all the cutting equipment to a space of bare metal floor. She set to work immediately, using the mechanical precision mode on the suit to cut sheets of magesteel into dozens of assemblable plates. Gripping the entire routing press between her suited hands, she cut mathematically precise runes of control, warding, and binding into each plate, with Solbus feeding them to her one at a time, in the fashion of a short assembly line. Like most men of the Dragoon, he was well used to dealing with manufacturing machines, but this was something else entirely. No part of Fleurette’s body was visible from outside the suit, and so it was much like working hand-in-hand with an extremely quick, wildly intelligent golem. The shells were designed as concentric dodecahedrons, with twenty three-pointed sides per shell. Each plate took Fleurette’s suit only a minute to cut, but with three shells, time was adding up.</p>
<p>Fleurette didn’t stop to take breaks, and neither did Solbus. The battle raged over the radio, a constant reminder of the reason for their urgency. Fleurette interpreted some of the frenetic chatter as being caused by side-effects of the dying core containment, making her paradoxically more confident that her analysis was accurate and more uncertain that they’d make it in time.</p>
<p>The final few stages were easily split between the two of them, so they both set to work filling the the runes with the proper magical alloy and welding the pieces together. Before long, they had a cylindrical truss structure around a spherical containment shell with dozens of super-heavy-duty power sockets on the top. Ilorgan tested it over and over as Fleurette clambered down out of her suit, exhausted and drenched in sweat. She looked terrible, all bandages and matted hair and sticky clothes.</p>
<p>“I suppose you’re going to tell me we don’t have time for a break,” Ilorgan said over the sound of the latest containment test.</p>
<p>“I need a drink,” Fleurette said, tumbling towards the pitcher on the desk.</p>
<p>“I thought you meant something stronger for a moment, like your father’s whiskey,” Solbus chuckled.</p>
<p>“You have some of that?” Fleurette asked, gasping for breath after a big gulp and turning around and around.</p>
<p>“It’s in a locked drawer. He gave it to me at the end of the War.”</p>
<p>“I’m not looking for whiskey, Master Ilorgan,” Fleurette said, slightly exasperated, “I’m looking for where you keep your sensory amplifiers.”</p>
<p>“They’re in that drawer by your hip. Why?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’re going to find a bunch of spare capacitors laying around here on the Lady, do you?”</p>
<p>“Fleurette, I wish you’d just tell me what you’re thinking…”</p>
<p>Fleurette fitted the massive old bronze goggles over her tangled bandage-bun and peered down through the floor, adjusting the instruments to their longest range. “We’re going to have to go somewhere else to get big enough capacitors for this. I’m going to have to get them from the Surface.”</p>
<p>Solbus stared at her in shock. “You’re going to what?”Fleurette walked to the radio and tuned it to a the switchboard frequency of the Dragoon. “This is Embless Mecanwaithe aboard the Lady of Blades. I have an urgent message for the Clockwork Dragoon.”</p>
<p>“This is the House communications room aboard the Clockwork Dragoon, can’t you see we’re a little busy over here?”</p>
<p>“I’m trying to save your ass. I’ve got tech over here that will blow your mind.”</p>
<p>“Let me get the commander on the line,” the communication officer said. Fleurette repeated herself several times, each to a new rank, until she got connected to the bridge.</p>
<p>“Captain Ra-Nydor, you are experiencing a deficit in your engine’s power output, aren’t you? I can fix that. I can even raise the efficiency of the engine. I just need authorization and a little help.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have time for this, Embless Mecanwaithe. Please formulate your concerns as a letter and send them to the bridge at a later date.”</p>
<p>“The main engine is corroded and the core containment field is leaking energy. It’s probably worsened in the battle. I can help. Please listen.”</p>
<p>“The engine is corroded?” he said, his voice betraying his newly focused attention.</p>
<p>“Yes. With the help of Master Ilorgan I have constructed a new containment shell, but to complete the transfer, we’ll need a capacitor rack big enough to keep the ship running while we swap the artifact.”</p>
<p>“You want to what?”</p>
<p>“Swap the artifact, Captain Ra-Nydor. During combat. Every second the containment field is stressed like this is another that it might detonate unless we shut down the engine and swap the artifact to a new containment core. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“The ship will fall out of the god damned sky!”</p>
<p>“You clearly don’t, then. Captain, that is why I need the capacitors. With a big enough rack of capacitors, we can run the ship for the minutes it will take us to switch the engine cores.”</p>
<p>The Captain said nothing for a few moments, clearly stunned. Eventually his voice returned. “What size of capacitors? I’ll get a team of mindworkers on it.”</p>
<p>“We’ll need probably about ten to fifteen minutes to replace the core, so…” Fleurette flicked through the math in her head, “Ninety-four or ninety-five mega-curons per second, about eighty-five giga-curons total. Lirex eleven, if we had just one.”</p>
<p>“What? That’s insane! We don’t have anything that big in the archives let alone in working order!”</p>
<p>Fleurette gulped back her trepidation. She’d been able to explain the situation clearly and calmly so far by being utterly convinced of the course of action. But this was the tricky part.</p>
<p>“I know that, sir. But I know where to get what I need.”</p>
<p>“Oh do tell,” the Captain said. She could hear in his voice that he had decided she was playing an elaborate and costly prank on him.</p>
<p>“I’m deadly serious, sir. I’ll have to venture to the Surface.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe a word of this,” the Captain started to say dismissively.</p>
<p>“Captain Ra-Nydor, I know it’s hard to believe; it’s an outlandish claim, but I cannot stand by knowing that there is a chance my family could die when I could have done something to save them. If you don’t trust me, trust my loyalty to my House.”</p>
<p>“And you’re sure you can repair the engine?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely, Captain.”</p>
<p>“And what about this enhancement?”</p>
<p>“My new design should increase the power output of the engine by fifty mega-curons over the current design spec.”</p>
<p>“A moment,” he sighed.</p>
<p>The Captain scanned the frenzied bridge with suspicion. He stepped into a privacy booth next to the communications officer’s station. Inside, he considered the possibilities of the technology the Embless was offering. He knew that House Mecanwaithe had proprietary power distribution technology, and that it was expensive. It could prove to be a lucrative course of action. He opened an encrypted channel on the private radio.</p>
<p>“Giotto, it’s Emrus. Open a line to the entire Council. That Mecanwaithe girl is has a proposition for us.”</p>
<p>“One moment, Emrus.” There was a series of clicks and pops that accompanied the signal change. “Alright, we’re all here now,” said the pleasant baritone.</p>
<p>“Greetings gentlemen. I apologize for the inconvenience of this message, but the matter is pressing. The Embless of house Mecanwaithe claims the Dragoon has an engine malfunction and is offering to fix it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, how generous of her,” said the baritone.</p>
<p>“I do not think so. To me, she sounds quite desperate. She claims that the engine containment is failing, and that she has a new containment system to replace it.”</p>
<p>“That sounds promising,” said different voice, one thick with mucous and punctuated with a hack.</p>
<p>“Yes, why don’t we let get on with it then?” said a plain, confident voice.</p>
<p>“She seems to think that the matter is urgent enough that she needs to complete the repair not just while we’re in the air, but as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Ah…” said another.</p>
<p>“But she requires parts from the Surface.”</p>
<p>“Oh really? What a brave little girl,” said the sickly voice.</p>
<p>“Yes, she claims her new containment will increase the output of the ship by fifty mega-curons per second.”</p>
<p>Murmurs of interest filled the audio channel.</p>
<p>“That would be valuable technology indeed,” said the baritone.</p>
<p>“Emrus. Reluctantly allow her to go, but send her with Kitharon and Salazar with her to keep an eye on her,” said a powerful, commanding voice.</p>
<p>“Say it’s for her protection,” added the smooth voice of Giotto Gliesar.</p>
<p>“We realize you’re not one to pander to anyone, let alone a little girl, but consider giving her the impression that the Dragoon is in desperate need of her help,” choked the phlegmatic Sem Pranthon.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” agreed the strong voice. “The more desperate she is to help, the harder she will work to give us wonderful inventions.”</p>
<p>“A wise proposition, gentlemen,” said the Captain.</p>
<p>“And be sure that our boys know that she’s a liability. If she endangers us, we can get rid of her on the surface,” continued the powerful bass.</p>
<p>“Clever, Margrave. The Fleet will never know what happened to her in that case,” the Captain mused. “Alright. I’ll send our men over to the Lady on a clipper to pick her up. From there they will take her to the surface and the cutter will return to the Dragoon.”</p>
<p>“I will speak with Salazar about the situation,” purred Gliesar.</p>
<p>“Thank you, gentlemen.”</p>
<p>The Captain cut the connection and tuned the booth radio to the signal from the Lady of Blades. “Embless, thank you for waiting. We have decided to grant your request, but we refuse to send you unarmed and alone. We will be sending Graf Kitharon to the Lady of Blades to protect you. You will take the Polite Request to the surface, as far as possible from the nesting zone of the fliers engaging the Clockwork Dragoon. Please go safely.”</p>
<p>“Aye, Captain Ra-Nydor,” Fleurette said, a burden lifting from her shoulders. Perhaps I can help them after all, she thought.</p>
<p>“And Embless, one more thing.”</p>
<p>“Yes Captain?”</p>
<p>“Be safe. We need your power more than you know.”</p>
<p>“Aye Sir!”The Polite Request did not merely dive. It screamed towards the ground like a meteor trailing exhaust in a cloud visible for thousands of meters. The mission was slated to take only a single hour, and every second the crew spent away from the Dragoon was another that men’s lives were on the line. Through the swarms and flights of fliers the sleek ship sped, nearly straight toward the ground. The flapping rubbery bodies fluttered against the reinforced glass of the bridge for only a the handful of seconds it took the ship to cover the better part of a thousand meters.</p>
<p>They suddenly burst through the gangly mass and into open air, barely a hundred meters from the cloud deck of the Lightning Sea.</p>
<p>“Okay, this part’s going to get kind of hairy,” Captain Renzo Salazar said over the roar of the thrumming engines.</p>
<p>“What part?” hollered Lombard just as the engines cut and the ship knifed through a net of lightning playing across the sky. He and Fleurette yelped as the momentum changed suddenly. The buffeting winds of the cloud layer threatened to turn the ship completely around. Salazar gripped the controls tightly and slammed the power back on the instant they cleared the Lightning Sea. The ship juddered mightily back and forth as he regained control over the direction of descent.</p>
<p>“Hold on to your lunch, you two,” he called back over his shoulder. The others gripped the arms of their flight seats with white knuckles. The ship pitched to the side, now traveling upside down and arcing backwards to their intended destination far below the Fleet.</p>
<p>“I hope you were right about this section of the Abyss, Fleurette,” shouted Lombard.</p>
<p>“Me too!” She called out, leaning sideways in her seat to see between the bulkheads and out the front glass. She didn’t look terrified. She looked elated, grinning ear to ear.</p>
<p>Lombard did a double-take at Fleurette. He stared at her in disbelief for a moment. A moment later, he was distracted by the view from the front of the ship again. Before them the canopy was rising up to meet them at hundreds of meters per second.</p>
<p>“PULL UP FOR THE CROWN’S SAKE!” howled Lombard.</p>
<p>“Not yet...” hissed Salazar between his gritted teeth.</p>
<p>From his back seat Lombard began to see what is all too clear to the Captain. There were swarms rising up from the canopy to meet them, but these were not swarms of gnat-like fliers only meters across. These were droves of dragons, hundreds of them, each easily as long as the ship itself. They took flight and rose, clawing up at the ship— just as the Request lanced through the flock and down though the meter wide leaves at the canopy and down into the titanic branches of the primordial forest of the Abyss.</p>
<p>Salazar yanked up on the controls and dumped engine power, bringing them into level flight between the massive trunks. He zipped and zagged between them for a mile or so, putting some distance between the ship and the scaly horde. Eventually he made a circle around a particularly large tree and landed the craft on the earthy floor of the gargantuan forest.Renzo patted Lombard on the back, a crooked smile playing across his lips. “It won’t be so bad going back up. It’ll be a slower trip. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Shut up. Get away from me. I just need a second,” the other man groused.</p>
<p>“I’m ready!” squealed Fleurette, pushing a quickly assembled cart from inside the ship.</p>
<p>“Hang on a second,” Salazar said, holding up a hand. He drew a symbol in the air and it split three ways and a shard fluttered over to each of them, twinkling to a stop near their ears. “You can send missives to each other with this. I’m staying with the ship, but this way you can let me know if you two get into trouble. We have about forty minutes before we need to lift off. Lets get a move on.”</p>
<p>Fleurette pushed the cart along, peering out from the ship’s hold and down into the jumbled gullies between the massive root structures. The ground sloped into valleys between these masses, and the telltale gleam of metal glistened in the crevasses.</p>
<p>“Over there, down in the water!” she whispered, pointing and wheeling the cart towards the slope.</p>
<p>“Be careful. This is all unknown territory,” Lombard said, scanning the area with suspicious contempt.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it exciting? I’ve only been on the ground a handful of times.”</p>
<p>She scampered down the slope and sloshed into the cold running water between the great thick roots. She snatched at the first object she saw, dredging up an entire mechanical skeleton almost as tall as herself. “Wow! This is incredible! These must be from scavengers who dig in the dirt for ore!”</p>
<p>“That’s great,” Lombard said, swinging his weapon back and forth, trying to watch all sides at the same time.</p>
<p>Fleurette dug around, gathering components. The skeletons had small magic generators, servos, mechanical eyes, and capacitors, all pre-assembled. Most of the components looked fairly intact so she worked with them carefully. The skeletons seemed to be inert only because they lacked enough power to operate. Who knew how few curons of mana it would take to start them up again?</p>
<p>She heaped five or six complete skeletons into the cart and pushed it up the slope with great, heaving breaths. She and Lombard hurried back to the ship with the first haul. They dumped the load unceremoniously into in a great cargo bin that they jury-rigged into the cargo section of the Request, then rushed right back out into the forest.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t that enough?” Lombard asked between breaths.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not; that was a bonus. Something around here has a bunch of capacitors that are still charged. Big ones. Those are the ones I need. The little guys are just gravy,” Fleurette said, peering around and looking for a more promising area to mine. She quickly picked a new spot based on the size of the armor plates scattered around a small pool of water.</p>
<p>After crossing several root-hills, Fleurette and Lombard came to the little pond. In it, they hit pay dirt. A large electro-magical turbine peeked up from the murky water. With a chain and some leverage they managed to surface the thing, revealing several cables still stuck in the mire as well. They heaved the cables free and Fleurette’s massive suit mimed several victorious gestures.</p>
<p>“Captain Salazar, how much weight can we take up with us?” Fleurette asked, huffing with exertion.</p>
<p>“With the gear we brought down, an extra two thousand kilos without breaking a sweat. Limit that to half since we’re concerned about the speed of our ascent. And please, dear. Call me Renzo.”</p>
<p>Lombard’s eyebrows contorted.</p>
<p>“We’re bringing some things in. Go ahead and open the gear case we brought down.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I left it unlocked. Just pull down the panels. Hurry up, I want it open and ready by the time we get back. We’re still on the clock.”</p>
<p>“What’s in it?” both the men asked by missive at the same time.</p>
<p>“You’ll see,” she said.</p>
<p>Fleurette and Lombard returned with the the cart just as Renzo got the crate open. Lombard skidded to a muddy stop next to him and they both stared in awe at the suit.</p>
<p>“Its a powered suit of armor,” she said, explaining as simply and quickly as she could. “I can lift just about anything with it.”</p>
<p>“Hurry up, shit’s about to get bad.”</p>
<p>“How dare you speak to an Embless in such foul language?” Lombard challenged.</p>
<p>Renzo just frowned and pointed up at the branches, at the patient, dripping maws hanging from the trees.</p>
<p>“Shit,” Lombard agreed.</p>
<p>“Indeed.”“Tell me they’ve left, Renzo,” Lombard said by missive.</p>
<p>“They’re still here, still staring at me.”</p>
<p>“Great damn, hurry up girl,” the Graf hissed as loud as he dared.</p>
<p>“And I know you two don’t want to hear this, but more are coming.”</p>
<p>“Almost done,” came Fleurette’s missive. The turbine was free, but she wanted to know what it was connected to. She gave a mighty pull in the cables and slowly dragged the skeletonized hull of a small ship to the surface.</p>
<p>“Whoa,” she breathed.</p>
<p>“Is that… what is that? Is that a ship?” Lombard asked, his head whipping between the pond and the canopy.</p>
<p>“It used to be,” Fleurette said.</p>
<p>“Can we take it with us?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. It’s too heavy for the Request to lift. Let’s just take the turbine and get out of here.” Fleurette turned in her suit of dirty armor and grappled with the massive chunk of machinery.</p>
<p>She strode up the hill as fast as Lombard could jog, as though the massive engine weighed nothing. “Halfway home,” she reported.</p>
<p>The two of them slowed to a stalk as they neared the ship, suspiciously watching the slavering monsters in the trees. Fleurette tried to be as quiet and unassuming as an two-and-a-half meter metal giant could possibly be. Hundreds of pairs of beady, red eyes watched her every movement.</p>
<p>“Lombard, go with Renzo and get to the other side of the ship. This is going to be a mess.”</p>
<p>Lombard stalked forward and grabbed a weapon from be bulkhead and stood in the cargo compartment Fleurette was headed for. “I’m not going to just hide,” he said, puffing out his chest. Renzo removed an ancient long spellgun from the bridge and stalked out to the other side of the ship, watching the creatures on the flank.</p>
<p>There was a quiet fluttering, like a blanket dropped from a building, then the heavy thunk of steak knife talons sinking into the mossy turf.</p>
<p>Fleurette glanced back.</p>
<p>Renzo took aim over the bow of the ship.</p>
<p>Lombard’s eyes went wide.</p>
<p>The fiend roared, sending slimy spittle at the suit. She took off running for the ship. The monster’s claws wrapped around the ankle of the suit just as Fleurette reached the rear cargo ramp, bringing her up short and causing her to catapult the giant turbine into the middle of the ship. The monster dragged at her, its back two pairs of legs gouging deep ruts in the loamy soil and shrieking a blood-chilling call to its brood-kin. The message was clear. Attack.</p>
<p>Suddenly the forest came alive with the beating of thick, fleshy wings and shark-like maws gaping and snapping at the exposed humans as they scrambled into the armored sections of the ship. Fleurette struggled forward on hydraulically powered arms, grasping, reaching, almost able to grab one of the specially designed weapons for the suit, still on it’s rack in the cargo hold of the ship. The monster behind her thrashed and strained against the strength of the suit, nearly cutting through the relatively thin armor of the greave of the servosuit. The monstrosities began to lay siege to the ship, tearing at it and rending it with their claws and teeth as the men inside quickened the weapons and started to fire back.</p>
<p>Fingers wrapped around a handle and a split-second later the monster’s head evaporated in a hot flash of red light and a reverberating ring. Fleurette stood up with her weapon, Lobelia, a heavy repeating spellgun unlike anything normal troops were capable of carrying. She proved Lobelia’s power by clearing the entire rear flank in a few moments. Renzo closed the ramp before any of the monsters already clambering over the ship could get inside.</p>
<p>The red blasts from Lobelia mixed with the yellow beams of the gun emplacements on the Request, scything open great swaths of cascading guts. Splashes of half-cauterized gore washed over the ship as the slaughter roared on. The blood seeped into the vent openings of the ship and inside the seams in Fleurette’s armor, drenching her clothes. A thrill ran through her body.</p>
<p>“Shut up, you crazed nutjob!” someone called over the missive spell.</p>
<p>Ashamed, Fleurette realized she had been laughing in excited glee the whole time. She tried to ratchet her emotions down a notch, with little success. She wasn’t just excited, she was positively intoxicated by the combat. Monsters rushed at her and she cut them down in a flash of spell power or bashed them open with a spiked fist, coating her suit with their blood. She couldn’t help but lose herself in the carnage.</p>
<p>A flash of magical energy and a sudden gout of smoke from Lobelia tolled the weapon’s end. She hurled it back towards the ship without a second look and, to the dismay of the men inside, waded deeper into the melee.</p>
<p>“Fleurette! NO!” shouted Renzo over the loudspeaker.</p>
<p>“Come back! We can’t cover you from over there!” hollered Lombard over the missive.</p>
<p>She waded through the battering sea of limbs as they struggled against her, seeking purchase in the gaps of her superior armor with their claws. She alone was the sole target of the horde. This was good. She wanted to draw them away from the now-damaged ship before it could run out of energy to defend itself with. Despite this, the men still continued to fire on the mass, careful to aim away from the center of the vortex of claws and teeth and wings.</p>
<p>She killed. She burst them, crushed them, ripped them, bashed, kicked and smashed. She destroyed the monsters. Their fury turned to fear much too late, when there were too few of them to stand against her. She continued slaughtering them anyway. The guns had long since stopped, but she kept on killing. She killed until the only living things in the area were three breathless, frenetic humans.</p>
<p>And she loved it.The guns had stopped when the Request’s generator ran out of power. It had been charging ever since, but until it had recharged enough power to lift the ship and three tons of extra cargo, they would all have to sit and wait, quietly. Not a sound was made outside or in.</p>
<p>They sat. They rested. Lombard had taken refuge in the hold. Renzo stared at Fleurette. The only clean part of her seemed to be her face and the particularly detailed blood-shadow of the suit’s harness across her chest, waist and thighs. In her fitful sleep she wore a deeply contented smile, the gratified look of someone exhausted by ecstasy.</p>
<p>I have to kill this girl, Renzo said to himself. I have orders to assassinate her if she becomes a liability to the elders. And it’s fairly damned obvious she’s a liability. If I don’t do it, Lombard will have to, he thought, rubbing the sockets of his eyes.</p>
<p>Lombard was in the middle of the ship, two bulkheads away, coveting the suit, enamored with its power. He didn’t even react when Renzo had told him they needed to speak about their mission. He was completely smitten with the suit the second she returned with it.</p>
<p>So I have to do it. I have to kill her before she kills anyone aboard the ship.</p>
<p>As a veteran of the Ground War, Renzo Salazar was no stranger to death. He was no stranger to killing men face to face, and regrettably, he was no stranger to killing women. In his years of service, however, he had only needed to kill with his bare hands a half-dozen times. It had not gotten easier. Sometimes he saw their faces when he slept.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I can take having this terrible and beautiful girl haunt me too, he thought, adjusting uncomfortably in his seat.</p>
<p>Slowly, with great heaviness in his heart, he got up from his seat and moved to the copilot seat where Fleurette, Embless of House Mecanwaithe lay sleeping, dreaming dark and fell dreams.</p>
<p>He pulled down his sleeves, anticipating that her during struggles she’d probably claw his arms up. He gulped. The button popped under his fingertips and he removed his knife from its sheath and leaned over her seat, gently taking the straps in one hand so as to hold her down as he performed his grim work. He tightened the straps slowly, without waking her, until he felt like they would hold against her flailing. He tugged back on them and she jerked awake, emitting a strangely erotic gasp and looking around as the long knife closed around her neck. He quickly drew it back toward her neck, but the seat collided backwards with his jaw, moving her neck out of the way of the blade and loosening his grip on the straps. She struggled against the straps. He stabbed at her neck but she lunged sideways like a snake as his blade caught in the headrest of the seat. She whipped an arm free of the straps and it battered the knife aside, more by accident than by clever fighting. The dagger drew a long wound down her perfect but already bloody forearm and clattered, ringing, under the captain’s seat.</p>
<p>He slammed his grip around her neck from behind the chair. The force of his attack crushed something between a gasp and a shriek from her lips. She started to writhe against the seat. Her breathing was cut off. He struggled to maintain his grip but she slipped free again, still slippery from the dragonkin blood. In a single fluid movement, she wrapped his arm up in the strapping and swung around the copilot’s chair, kicking him in the thigh as she passed. The two struggled around each other until they ended up in a tangle on the floor of the bridge, struggling against each other. Despite his larger size and strength, her agility, slipperiness and terror turned the fight into a stalemate.</p>
<p>Fleurette’s heart was pounding in her chest. Renzo could hear it. After all the noise so far, it was her throbbing pulse that he was concerned Lombard would finally notice.</p>
<p>She kissed him first. She wrapped an arm around his neck and pressed her lips to the corner of his mouth. He peeled her arm from his neck and forced both her wrists to the grated floor and smothered her cracked lips with his own. She squirmed under his body. She kicked his knee out from under him and he fell on her, eliciting a gasp and another kiss on his neck. He took both of her narrow, slick wrists in one hand and gripped her spine, turning her head and exposing a cleaner spot on her soft, smooth neck. He kissed there, feeling the blood pumping vitally beneath the skin at his lips. He kissed her mouth again, and that time their tongues entwined. She squeezed herself against him, arching off the floor, passion-drunk. He ran his hands over her body, savoring her supple form and crushing it against himself. She wrapped her arms around him and gasped, lost in sensation.</p>
<p>“I…” he began, but he lost his thought. She had stopped moving against him, and stared at him in dazed bewilderment.</p>
<p>She gulped, looking suddenly tiny and helpless and vulnerable in his arms.</p>
<p>“Shit,” he cursed himself, turning away from her confused, naive eyes. What the fuck were we doing? What is wrong with us? he pondered, extricating himself gently from her shuddering limbs.</p>
<p>“It’s over,” he said. “I can’t do this.”</p>
<p>She stared at him, eyes welling with tears, reeling in shock and panic.</p>
<p>“Hey. Lets clean this up,” he said, reaching for the wrist with the cut from his long knife, but she snatched it away and scuttled into the corner between the copilot’s chair and the bulkhead.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. You’re fine. I’m sorry. I’m not going to do anything anymore. I couldn’t make myself if I had to.”</p>
<p>There was a whine that rose in pitch until the breaker reset and the console and overhead lights came on all at once.</p>
<p>Fleurette screamed.Lombard and Renzo stood in bright vertical columns of light in the middle of a pitch black room, like specimens under a microscope. A door opened, visible only by the light beyond it, and several figures shuffled in. The first was the gangly, rail-thin, sputtering form of Sem Pranthon. The second was the tall, angular form of Giotto Gliesar. The third was the broad, sturdy frame of Captain Emrus Ra-Nydor. The final figure to enter the room was the bulky, solid shape of Tyfon Glorgox.</p>
<p>“The Kaiser Admiral will not be in attendance,” related the Captain.</p>
<p>The two men standing in the light straightened up and saluted the figures, who had walked into a rough square around the center of the room. Only the reflection from the polished floor lit the faces of the men around the table. Each wore a unique combination of interest, excitement, and impatience.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen. Make your report,” slubbered the sickly Earl.</p>
<p>The two men glanced at each other. Lombard, feeling skittish about such a high-profile job, made no move to speak first. Renzo raised his head and addresses to the group.</p>
<p>“We followed your orders, elders. Graf Kitharon was brought by courier to the Lady, where we made our preparations. He collected Mecanwaithe. He brought her to the Request and we set off at a steep reach to avoid damage to the ship. We passed the cloud layer, dove through a swarm, and penetrated the canopy. Once there, we landed in a clearing near a large tree and the Graf and Mecanwaithe left to reconnoiter.</p>
<p>“They came across the remains of some small mechanical creatures that died in a river and brought the components back via a cart. They then left for more components. I became aware that the denizens of the forest were becoming interested in the ship so I turned several systems off so as to prevent them from homing in on the signature of the engine so easily.</p>
<p>“Then the others reported that they’d found the target of their search. Mecanwaithe had located a turbine and returned with some components. She returned to liberate the turbine while I stayed with the ship. By the time they came back, the monsters were ready to swarm.</p>
<p>“At that time, the forest creatures attacked the ship. Many more had arrived while the Graf and Mecanwaithe were away gathering parts. They assaulted the ship and we fought them off with the ship’s weaponry. The Graf did a commendable job on the port-side turret.</p>
<p>“We expended all the energy in the magic generator and we were forced to rest for a bit before returning to the Dragoon.”</p>
<p>Lombard shifted uncomfortably, his eyes betraying some concealed truth.</p>
<p>“Do you have something to add, Graf Kitharon?”</p>
<p>Renzo stared straight ahead, giving nothing away. Inside, he raged for Lombard to hold his tongue. He willed the other man to give up, to fold under the pressure, overcome with the stress of standing before the elders.</p>
<p>“Y-yes sir. There is something that Captain Salazar left out...” he began nervously.</p>
<p>“My report was technically accurate,” he countered, trying not to sound contrary.</p>
<p>“My Lords, there were other events while we were under siege,” Lombard pressed on. “You see, the Captain and I were the only ones inside the ship during the siege.”</p>
<p>The shrouded figures exchanged looks. Renzo could then feel the full, undivided attention of the elders focused on him.</p>
<p>“Where was Mecanwaithe at the time of the siege, Captain Salazar?” asked the soothing voice.</p>
<p>“She was outside the ship, Marquis Gliesar,” he said glibly.</p>
<p>“She was outside slaughtering the abominations of the forest like they were nothing!” gushed Lombard.</p>
<p>The burning stares seared into Renzo.</p>
<p>“How was this so, Captain?” asked the powerful voice.</p>
<p>“She was armed and armored, Margrave Glorgox,” he said.</p>
<p>“Armed with what? Armored in what manner?” pried Captain Ra-Nydor.</p>
<p>“It was some kind of suit of armor. She said it was powered. It had it’s own generator, my Lord. She was absolute in it. Invincible. The monsters’ claws could barely—”</p>
<p>“And armed with what?”</p>
<p>“She had a spellgun that was bigger and more powerful than any man portable gun I’ve laid eyes on,” he said.</p>
<p>The elders digested this for some time.</p>
<p>“Why did you not mention these devices in your report, Captain Salazar?” Earl Pranthon asked, snorting something onto the floor.</p>
<p>The figures hung on his response. He could feel it. This had gone from a report to an interrogation, thanks to the Graf. He might not leave the room alive, let alone in trust, if he failed to answer in a satisfactory way. He decide to go out boldly, as had always been his way.</p>
<p>“I’ll be honest, my Lords. I was rather hoping that the Graf would fail to mention it.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I wasn’t sure what I had seen was even real, and because if it was, I would rather steal it for myself.”Fleurette took a deep guzzle of water. She wiped her mouth, gasping for air. It had taken almost a half-hour to explain the entire trip to her friends, and she wasn’t quite finished yet. Cybeline lay on her stomach on the bed, skirt pulled up to her knees so she could kick Fleurette’s pillow freely and still watch her work at her desk. Charlotte, who was dragged to the room forcibly, had curled into the vast fluff of the plush chair in the corner, peaking from over a throw and listening wide-eyed.</p>
<p>But no more story was forthcoming.</p>
<p>Fleurette had abruptly terminated the tale after the battle. She sketched away at the designs for the new hub stations.</p>
<p>“That is so not the end of the story. I can see it on your face,” Cybeline said.</p>
<p>“What happened after you massacred the horde of dragon-kin?” asked Charlotte.</p>
<p>“Is everyone alright?”</p>
<p>“Yes, everyone’s fine...” she said, exasperated. She turned away from the drawings she was doing of the power system and picked up a few bits of metal. Charlotte and Cybeline both knew that Fleurette had a habit of tinkering with something when she wasn’t telling the truth.</p>
<p>Fleurette looked up at the other two with wide, teary eyes.</p>
<p>“He... He sort of tried to kill me.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Who did?”</p>
<p>“He came after me when I was asleep, exhausted from fighting. He tried to tie me to my chair and cut my throat. But I escaped and hit him. I knocked the knife away and we fought. He was so strong...</p>
<p>“I... We rolled onto the floor and struggled. He had the upper hand, but at that point I... I don’t know what I was thinking. He was just so strong and there and on me...”</p>
<p>“Yes?” cried Cybeline. “Spit it out!”</p>
<p>“Shh...” shushed Charlotte. She clambered out of the chair and crossed to sit next to Fleurette, pinching Cybeline stealthily along the way. She wrapped her arms around Fleurette’s narrow shoulders. In her lighter, less fancy work clothes she looked even more tiny and delicate than usual.</p>
<p>“I kissed him. He was just so... furious, so passionate. I was crazy. I must have been. I completely lost my mind.”</p>
<p>Cybeline and Charlotte sat staring at her in disbelief for a long moment.</p>
<p>“Did he kiss you back?” Charlotte asked gently. Cybeline nodded vigorously for her to answer the juicy question, so she didn’t notice the distant, sad look on Charlotte’s face.</p>
<p>“He... he kissed me back. He pressed me against him and we kissed each other on the neck and lips.”</p>
<p>Cybeline’s jaw dangled. Charlotte effected a smirk to disguise her feelings.</p>
<p>“You... made out with Captain Salazar? That is so amazing!” Cybeline squealed and Charlotte tried to giggle a little bit along with her. Fleurette blushed a deep red. Despite her wounded pride, Charlotte found herself relieved the event had transformed from a near-death experience into a relatively benign romantic escapade.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad you’re safe,” Charlotte said, squeezing Fleurette hard.</p>
<p>“Me too!” said Cybeline, leaping from the bed to smother her in a hug. The two managed to drag her to the bed and toss her onto it, settling nearby.</p>
<p>“So, was he a good kisser?” Charlotte asked, trying to help the levity along.</p>
<p>Fleurette blushed again and buried her face in a pillow. “Very,” her muffled voice said.</p>
<p>Cybeline squealed in delight and Charlotte winced out a smile. Despite Fleurette’s attempts to get back to work, the pair of them spent the next half-hour extricating every detail of Fleurette’s romantic interlude from her memory.Charlotte left Fleurette’s room with Cybeline. They crept through the hallway back towards their rooms, trying not to disturb any of the other students. It wasn’t that late, but many went to bed early in preparation for dance practice the next afternoon.</p>
<p>“See you tomorrow,” Charlotte whispered when they reached Cybeline’s door.</p>
<p>“Night night,” Cybeline replied, ducking her head in a polite bow as she closed her door.</p>
<p>Charlotte stood for a moment, considering what she ought to do with her evening. She unclenched her hands, having not realized she was doing so.</p>
<p>Might as well go for a walk, she said to herself, trying to clear her mind.</p>
<p>Charlotte found herself out on one of the hydroponics pads moments later. Only the cold, stiff wind of the outside had pulled her back to reality. She shook her head, freeing her long, dark waves. Pushing her hair out of her face, she walked towards the edge of the pad. It was railed with sturdy steel pipes up to her chest to prevent anyone from going overboard accidentally.</p>
<p>The surface of the Lady of Blades was different from the Dragoon and the Maw. The Dragoon was well armored and modular, with frames and panels that could be replaced or moved. The Maw was among the most heavily armored in the Fleet, with dark, heavy plates that overlapped like fine plate armor. The Lady’s armor was light and decorative, with soft, almost floral lines and refined patterns. The silvery skin of the ship reflected the dark sky and the bright moons.</p>
<p>Below her, she heard the sound of a gunship. She looked down and aft, spotting a small ship as it came to a rest on the extended deck of the landing bay. She gazed down on it, momentarily forgetting what she had been angry about.</p>
<p>The captain stepped out of his ship and went around his vessel, checking damaged parts and rends in the armor. She realized with a start that she was watching Renzo Salazar and her chest grew tight. Her heart felt like it was bouncing off her ribs with each beat. She gazed down at him, gripping the rail tightly as she struggled to control her emotions.</p>
<p>It was wrong of her to desire her friend. Regardless of the fact that Fleurette already had a relationship with Graf Kitharon, even her romance with Salazar was more wholesome than Charlotte’s feelings for Fleurette. Charlotte’s anger rose in her throat until she strained her wrists against the bars. If she could have, she would have torn the rail from the fence and hurled it overboard in frustration.</p>
<p>It had cut her so deeply to watch Fleurette delight over her own seduction. Charlotte had never seen anyone pine for someone so much. She wanted Fleurette to feel that way about her. Guilt slithered in as she realized that she hated Salazar for his fortune.</p>
<p>I am cursed, she decided. My father cursed me with his name and now I am doomed to be her enemy.</p>
<p>Charlotte slammed her fists against the railing. Captain Salazar glanced up at the sound, but he couldn’t have made her out from his angle. She glowered down at him, struggling not to despise him. She wanted Fleurette to be happy, but she almost couldn’t stand the thought of someone else touching her friend.</p>
<p>She sighed, collapsing by the edge of the pad in tears. It would be better for her if I supported her, she thought. It would be better if she never found out about this. She doesn’t need my problems. She doesn’t need House Glorgox breathing down the back of her neck…</p>
<p>Shaking her head to banish the image of Fleurette’s slender neck, she turned her back to the rail and wrapped her arms around her knees.</p>
<p>I’ll do my best, for her sake.</p>
<p>I should have talked to them after, Fleurette chided herself as she hurriedly unlocked the door to the workshop she shared with Master Solbus. The siege was still going on over aboard the Dragoon and her nerves were still too tightly wound for her to finish her designs. She needed to get to work before it was too late.</p>
<p>She didn’t know how long it had been since she’d left the Lady to go to the surface. She feared the siege had started hours ago. Working backward from the snippets she’d heard, the battle had been going on for two to four hours, possibly making it one of the most lengthy attacks in years.</p>
<p>Fleurette started by finishing the rough designs Cybeline and Charlotte had distracted her from. She sketched a few orthographic views of the main components of the new system. In the margin she made a list of procedures that would have to be followed to keep the ship running while the technicians completed the upgrade.</p>
<p>Her plan split the ship into four main sections. She would have split it into more if the scrap they had salvaged from the surface had been more useful, but she only came up with four usable power cores that would support the loads required. With all the components at least sketched out, she circled the ones she would need to complete herself. The rest could be manufactured faster and better in the spellworks aboard the Dragoon.</p>
<p>She set to work on stripping the power cores first, discharging them into the Lady’s main grid. She used a powerful cutter to slice through the outer casings and pulled the crystals out of the sticky capacitance gel. By the time she had freed the four crystals, she was green up to her elbows in the tingling, viscous liquid. Rather than take the time to wash properly, she merely wiped it off with a rag, trusting her years of experience to stop her from touching anything carrying a charge. Her father would have lectured her until her ears fell off for it, but she was in a hurry.</p>
<p>She examined the cores with a cursory glance. Each was a crystal the size of her hand wrapped in metal wires and thin vines. Her design didn’t call for any life-essence storage, so she trimmed away the organic components with a rushed scalpel. She knew from the discharge earlier that the wires wrapped around the crystals would do fine for power transfer, but she didn’t want to have to replace them, ever. She found some tetron cables that could transfer six orders of magnitude more power than the existing megon wires and snatched them from the bin. Then she rinsed the crystals off in a mild acid bath to clean off all traces of the old capacitance gel.</p>
<p>Once the cores were ready, she climbed back into her gory servosuit and started it back up. She grabbed four blocks of solid magesteel and her cutting tools. Next, she drilled holes for anchoring the cores down, then sawed off the ends of the blocks. She hollowed out the interiors using the servosuit’s mathematical precision mode. Finally, she routed out channels to contain a seal ring so that the casings wouldn’t leak.</p>
<p>She scrambled out of the suit when she saw the time. If they were still battling aboard the Dragoon, it would be one of the longest battles in history by now.</p>
<p>Fleurette drilled out holes in the caps for the cabling and fitted articulated metal line guards to the holes. Carefully, she set a crystal into its seat in the lid and tugged the thick cables out into the proper exits. That was when she realized she’d missed a step. Her heart paused and her breath caught in panic.</p>
<p>Carefully, she set the half-finished power core down and rushed to her alchemy table. She didn’t have the materials to make capacitance gel from scratch, so she skipped a few ingredients, deciding to make up the difference with brute force magic. She measured out the proper proportions of several different substances and mixed them in a large bucket until they were clear. After snatching up a pen, she took a moment to inscribe a complex sigil on a scroll of pre-charged parchment and dunked it into the liquid with a set of tongs. She was almost hyperventilating now, and the fumes from the alchemical chaos in the bucket nearly caused her to faint. She sat on the desk and set up the remaining three caps while she waited for the capacitance gel to precipitate.</p>
<p>When the bucket frosted over, she knew the process was finished. With great care, she poured the gel into each of the four open cases, shaking the bone-chilling cold from her hands between each filling. She left a little room at the top for the displacement of the crystal. Once they were all ready, she carefully dunked the crystals in the gel and fitted the caps over the new power cores.</p>
<p>Fleurette collapsed for a momentary break, then called the docks from Solbus’s ancient radio. She directed them to find Captain Salazar and send him to her room as soon as possible, then went back to work.</p>
<p>She didn’t have the materials or equipment to build the consoles herself, but she didn’t trust anyone at the spellworks to do the distribution logic properly. She clambered back into her suit and carved four power station seats out of her dwindling stock of magesteel. She carved the control boxes right into them and punched extra holes into the housings in case she’d forgotten something.</p>
<p>By the time Renzo arrived, Fleurette had done all the metaphysics and logic for all four of the hub stations and sealed the control scrolls into their boxes. She was fitting the power cores into their seats when he walked in.</p>
<p>“Uh,” he said, uncertain of how to deal with seeing her again so soon.</p>
<p>“Almost done,” she said automatically. “Roll up those papers over there and put them in a case. There should be one in the corner.”</p>
<p>“Fleurette…”</p>
<p>“I said I’m almost done.”</p>
<p>“It’s over. They won hours ago. You can relax.”</p>
<p>Fleurette dropped her screwdriver as her muscles lost tension.</p>
<p>“Oh,” she said. Her voice was as empty as the night sky.</p>
<p>“Well don’t look at me. I’ve had plenty of suitors come calling but my father won’t have any of it,” Charlotte said, stuffed into her favorite chair in the corner of Fleurette’s room.</p>
<p>Fleurette still looked sleepy despite having slept for nearly two days. The flurry of activity surrounding the battle aboard the Dragoon had drained her physically and emotionally.</p>
<p>Once she was well again, the girls had gathered at her place, to discuss a hypothetical attempt to make Fleurette and Captain Salazar a couple. It was also something of a celebration of Fleurette’s recent victory and recent inventions, but such technical matters paled in the face of a young woman’s matchmaking session.</p>
<p>“I’ve never really gotten very far with anyone before, either,” said Cybeline. “What about that Graf you know? Aren’t you and he sort of courting each other?”</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, why didn’t he stop you two from eating each other’s faces?” Charlotte asked, all false bravado.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. I don’t know where he was at the time. I was pretty delirious at the time. I never even thought about him. He just never crossed my mind,” she said, her cast her eyes down in shame.</p>
<p>“Sounds like he’s out of the running,” Cybeline said. “Damn, I was hoping we could draw from someone’s experience. This isn’t going to be easy with nothing but lousy romance serials for reference.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I have read a lot about kissing though,” Charlotte pitched in.</p>
<p>“And I have all kinds of ideas for your wardrobe,” Cybeline said, scampering for the closet. She dove in and started rummaging. “Did you buy that dress I told you to buy?” she called out, already buried in her work.</p>
<p>“Not yet. I was busy trying to save the Dragoon.”</p>
<p>Charlotte gently took Fleurette’s chin and turned her face so she could decorate her lips with a thin coat of glossy wax. “There,” she said, admiring her handiwork. She winked at Fleurette who winked back melodramatically.</p>
<p>“You should. It was perfect for you. I’m sure the tailor can even add a little something in the front for you.”</p>
<p>“Are you insulting my moderately sized chest?” Fleurette said to the scuffling closet.</p>
<p>“I’m merely saying you could use a little help.”</p>
<p>Charlotte tilted Fleurette’s head back, applying a layer of color to her eyelids. It was quiet for a moment, aside from the jostling in the closet.</p>
<p>“Did you use your tongue when you kissed him?” Charlotte asked, quietly biting her lip.</p>
<p>Fleurette studied her hands in her lap, nodding and flushing again.</p>
<p>“Good, let him take control, but don’t be a pushover. You have to meet him half way.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Should she be taking notes?” asked the closet.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Charlotte, acting professorial. “And it is now time for the practicum.”</p>
<p>Fleurette’s eyebrows knitted together, confused.</p>
<p>“You need practice, don’t you?” she asked, as though it were perfectly obvious.</p>
<p>Realizing what she meant, Fleurette flushed at the implied proposal. She couldn’t help but notice Charlotte’s glossy, delicious lips, the smooth line of her jaw. She gulped, mustered her courage, and nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Just practice,” she said, quiet as a feather in the wind. She sidled towards Charlotte who crawled across the bed, taking on a rather convincing dominant gaze.</p>
<p>“Remember to meet him half-way,” Charlotte whispered, leaning in. She craned her head so close that Fleurette could smell the subtle scent of her neck beneath her perfume. “He just goes right for what he wants, doesn’t he?” she asked, her dark eyes swallowing Fleurette whole. Fleurette felt her pulse in her ears and in her stomach. She nodded again to answer the question, afraid to ruin the moment with words.</p>
<p>Charlotte teased up the most predatory smile she could imagine, based on what she’d seen of Salazar. She crawled even closer, her arms holding her over most of Fleurette’s body. She leaned in, too fast for Fleurette to stop her but too slow for her aching heart, lips parted, and kissed her firmly. She slipped her tongue across Fleurette’s lips and touched the other girl’s tongue with her own. She crept further over her, assuming a more dominant position. She wrapped one arm around Fleurette’s quivering body and pulled her close. She felt stronger than Fleurette had ever imagined, maybe even as strong as Renzo. She melted in Charlotte’s grasp.</p>
<p>“Oh come now. Going all weak at the knees isn’t going to impress him,” Charlotte mocked after breaking the kiss and shooting her a wry look. Fleurette noticed a blush rising on Charlotte’s cheeks and bit her lip, gathering her wrecked courage all over again.</p>
<p>“That’s a cute look,” Charlotte complimented.</p>
<p>Fleurette leaned up into her again, closing her eyes and kissed Charlotte, trying to do her best at drawing her in and being firm at the same time. She couldn’t help yielding to Charlotte’s assertive lips. She moaned, falling backward, pulling Charlotte over on top of her. Charlotte squeezed Fleurette, nibbling at the corner of her mouth and then her neck. The sensual sounds drew Cybeline from the closet. She peeked from inside and over a filly old dress, eyes wide, jaw slack. Fleurette snapped to look at her in shock. She scrambled backwards from under Charlotte as she licked her lips and sat back, looking uncertain but pleased.</p>
<p>“What... are—”</p>
<p>“Practice.”</p>
<p>“But you—”</p>
<p>“She needed the help.”</p>
<p>“I have to go,” Cybeline stumbled, fleeing the awkward room.</p>
<p>Charlotte sighed. “I’ll go talk to her”</p>
<p>Fleurette had barely squeaked out an affirmative before Charlotte slid off the bed. She paused by the door, pulling on her heels.</p>
<p>“When we’re alone, you can call me Lottie,” she said, facing the door. The small portion of her cheek that Fleurette could see blushed bright red.</p>
<p>“Hawa,” she returned, her voice for once as tiny as her petite frame.</p>
<p>“Is that short for something?” Charlotte asked.</p>
<p>“My middle name. Its Hawawa. Old Imperial. My mother gave it to me. Nobody uses it except my little sisters.”</p>
<p>“Hawa. It’s cute. What does it mean?”</p>
<p>“It means dainty or petite,” she said, sinking into the bed in embarrassment .</p>
<p>Charlotte smiled sweetly. “Good night, Hawa.”</p>
<p>“Night, Lottie,” Fleurette replied from the covers.“There’s only one way to be absolutely sure,” said Braelyn. She ran her hand through her spiky hair. “We have to inspect her room. We’ll go when she and the Countess are out,” she said to her cadre, too quiet for the Cybeline to hear from the plush seat across the student lounge.</p>
<p>Braelyn returned to the Cybeline and stroked her shoulder in calculated comfort. “I know this is tough, Cybeline. We’ll get this all sorted out. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>The coven of girls around Braelyn thanked Cybeline for bringing this vulgarity to their attention. “You did the right thing, coming to the Class Morality Council. We’ll see that you don’t go unrewarded.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t misunderstand. I don’t know what they were doing. I just want to know what happened. I don’t want to get them in trouble if they didn’t do anything wrong.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, dear,” Braelyn said, giving her a firm hug. “Everything will be fine. No one’s going to get in trouble. We’ll just find out what they were up to. It was probably just a practical joke that you didn’t catch. We don’t suspect them of anything.”The girls arrayed themselves around her, looking casual, trying not to clump around the door suspiciously. They turned every which way, subtly watching for any sign of trouble down the long, elaborate hallway.</p>
<p>Braelyn worked the knob, fiddling with small tools that looked like surgical implements to Cybeline. “Should we be doing this?” she whispered to the older girl.</p>
<p>“It’s fine, Cybeline,” she said conversationally. “We’re just checking for a few things. Using some fancy magic we can replay what happened. We’ll just show you what they did and why it’s silly to be worried, then we’ll be gone.” Fleurette’s door gave in and popped open abruptly.</p>
<p>The girls filtered in and found that the room was quite crowded for seven people wearing widely flared skirts. They began to carefully browse the items of the room, cataloging everything they came across. Even Cybeline got caught up in the search after a moment. She didn’t even know what the group was looking for, but she hoped to find it soon and be done with the skulking around.</p>
<p>The morality council handled all sorts of things, gears and sprockets, mechanical parts, metal shells, and spellgun cartridges. There were too many interesting artifacts in her room and the girls were easily distracted. After a few minutes of this, Braelyn hissed for them to get back to proper work.</p>
<p>“Oh! My goodness,” exclaimed one girl, retracting her hand from a drawer as though there were a snake inside. She reached back in as everyone turned to look at her, drawing a long, cylindrical object from the dresser. The brass shape was polished to a fine sheen. The sides were mostly smooth, with small spiral ridges at the more tapered side and small bumps a few centimeters from the flattened end.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to confiscate that, I think,” Braelyn said sadly.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Cybeline asked innocently.</p>
<p>“It’s a... well, you see...” began one girl, apparently embarrassed.</p>
<p>“It seems your friend has been experimenting with her body,” Braelyn said. It took a few moments to sink in. Cybeline suddenly shuddered at the thought of using the device.</p>
<p>“Ew,” she said.</p>
<p>The sound of shuffling and rummaging was the only sound for a few more minutes.</p>
<p>“What’s this here?” said the short girl, holding up a sheaf of papers. She leafed through it, some others looking over her shoulder. It turned out to be nothing but mechanical drawings and sketches... until they found a picture of Cybeline.</p>
<p>“Oh my, is that you?” The girl inquired.</p>
<p>“She is rather good,” said another.</p>
<p>“Check in that folder.”</p>
<p>Gasps sounded from the group, drawing the other girls over to their cluster. In their shaking hands was a stack of drawing paper, inscribed with lovingly detailed portraits of dozens of girls. Several other girls of the group were featured in the drawings.</p>
<p>But the number one subject in the drawings was by far Charlotte.</p>
<p>At first, Cybeline couldn’t believe it. She assumed it was some other girl with a similar complexion. Unfortunately, Fleurette’s drawing skill had grown to the point of making questions about the subject’s identity moot. The fine drawings were shaded and detailed with such skill that they might have been displayed in a gallery if the girls hadn’t gotten hold of them.</p>
<p>It had been clear to all the others all along. Cybeline was forced to accept the obvious conclusion: there was something between her friends.</p>
<p>“There’s still the spell,” Braelyn said gently, trying not to provoke Cybeline’s emotions. “Unless you don’t think we need to go that far.”</p>
<p>“No...” she said, quavering, “We should use it. We can’t know for sure...” she choked off with grief.</p>
<p>The girl with the tome walked to the edge of the bed. The air was tense, expectant. She glanced at Cybeline and Braelyn for approval before beginning. With their blessing, she opened the book and incanted the spell. The glyphs of the magic settled like a mirage over the bed, quickly forming the shapes of Fleurette and Charlotte.</p>
<p>The two ghostly forms of the girls moved together and kissed several times, completely unaware of their audience. They slipped down to the bed and continued kissing and cradling each other. The runes only outlined the forms of their bodies, but the language of those bodies was unmistakable. The image dissipated in a fog of dissolving divination.</p>
<p>Cybeline’s eyes were full of tears that she tried to wipe away. She was oblivious to the wink of understanding exchanged by Braelyn and her subordinate.</p>
<p>“Lets see what happened after you left,” Braelyn said. The mindworker girl lifted the book and flipped to a different page. She incanted a different spell this time. Instead of the glyphs of the last spell, the quavery forms of the two girls appeared by coalescing out of mist in the air. The images this spell produced were much more realistic and highly detailed. Cybeline’s brow furrowed. Something seemed artificial about the image, but the image itself was too shocking. Braelyn’s trick had distracted her from the truth.</p>
<p>The girls were laying on the bed, Charlotte on top. She continued to kiss Fleurette, her hands pawing at the other girl. Fleurette reached down to Charlotte’s smooth thighs and lifted her skirt slowly. She stroked her legs, moaning louder and louder as Charlotte nibbled down her collarbone. They kissed feverishly and Fleurette’s ghost began to unlace Charlotte’s corset.</p>
<p>“That’s enough,” Braelyn said solemnly. Despite her actions, she still felt a twinge of guilt at her betrayal. She masked her emotions and turned to Cybeline to embraced her. “There, there. It’ll be okay. We’ll do something about this.”This really isn’t the right time for a dance, Fleurette thought, browsing the dresses at the fanciest shop in the fashion district. She cast another dress onto the chair.</p>
<p>“I liked that one,” Charlotte said stiffly.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, you brought me out here to the Kalafin and I’ve got my head stuck in the clouds.”</p>
<p>“Here, try this one,” Charlotte whispered, passing a silky, lacy confection to her and bustling her into the dressing room again.</p>
<p>Fleurette stepped out twenty minutes later.</p>
<p>“Oh, my word, you look simply gorgeous,” one of the seamstresses said.</p>
<p>The other came over and swooned, covering her mouth with her hands as her eyes teared up. “So perfect,” she whispered in awe.</p>
<p>Fleurette waved them off and turned around in the mirror.</p>
<p>In the current fashion, the silky skirt only came down to the knees but retained a long, almost train-like bustle in the back that suited Fleurette’s petite form. The ribbed bodice was studded with expensive little clasp closures and hugged her slender body, shaping it subtly in a more womanly way. The detached sleeves showed just enough shoulder to titillate the men but not quite enough to be scandalous. She was slightly embarrassed at how low the front of the bodice went down; the smooth front of the corset reached nearly down to the line of her low-cut underwear, but she couldn’t deny that it accentuated her waist and hips nicely.</p>
<p>The general trend for the last few centuries had been to portray fitness and finely toned muscles as attractive, rather than the plump, well fed look of ages past. Fleurette was fortunate enough to be naturally built in a way that modern men found attractive, if quite a bit shorter and more slender than average. The dress did a fine job of emphasizing her appearance.</p>
<p>Fleurette turned to Charlotte. She found herself more concerned with her friend’s opinion than the professional seamstresses. More than she ever would have before.</p>
<p>“How do I look?” she queried shyly.</p>
<p>Charlotte bit her lip at the coy question and the seamstresses swooned.</p>
<p>“You look every penny worth your title. And then some. You’ll knock him dead,” she said with a wink.As was customary, the girls entered the Passing Ball from the grand staircase nearly forty minutes after the male guests had arrived. They sashayed down the stairs, each girl showing off her gorgeous dress to the potential suitors. Even those who were already engaged did their best to show off. The men might not have noticed, but there was an entirely different kind of war going on. A subtle war. One of grace and status, position and maneuvering.</p>
<p>Fleurette came down the stairs amid a group that nearly blotted out her silky red form. She spent a heart-stopping handful of seconds searching for Renzo, but couldn’t find him. Instead, her guilty eyes caught sight of Lombard. Her heart sank as she realized that she’d rather be stolen away by the Captain than spend her life with the Graf.</p>
<p>Or so she told herself. Such dances were always stressful for the women of the Lady of Blades but Fleurette suffered from attacks of uncertainty in addition to the usual social pressure.</p>
<p>The stairs seem to take forever as she dwelt on the kiss with Charlotte. Plural, she had to remind herself. She couldn’t keep the taste and feel of her friend’s lips from her mind. It made searching for her suitors a distracted business.</p>
<p>When she did find Renzo in the crowd, she was quite surprised. She never really expected that a private Captain with his own ship would bother to come to a dance at the Lady of Blades.</p>
<p>Then again, she thought, glancing over at Charlotte’s glimmery, evanescent form, This might be exactly the kind of thing that attracts men.</p>
<p>The crowd of men arrayed around the ballroom floor were overcome by a hushed, awed quiet as the colorful, fascinating girls floated down the stairs and into the crowd. The orchestra began a quiet adagio meant for introductions and conversation.</p>
<p>The girls mingled with the boys, usually keeping in small clusters for safety. It was a polite battle, one where social grace was the best defense and a clever turn of phrase was the best weapon. Squadrons of sisters in arms sought out the company of the most desirable boys, crowding around the most rich, ingenious, and attractive young men. Quiet betrayals swarmed as friends dueled wits over the prized affections of aristocrats.</p>
<p>Amid the quiet, subdued swirl of dresses and suits, Fleurette swam against the current toward her suitors. She spied Renzo first, but after making brief eye contact his gaze slid off of her as though it found no purchase. She moved closer and was spotted again, and again his eyes wandered away. It was as though he were trying to avoid her. Frustrated by his cool attitude, she went in search of a warmer reception.</p>
<p>Lombard was far more interested than his rival. By the time Fleurette caught sight of him again, he was already watching her. His eyes smoldered with some unknown passion, desire she had never seen in him before. It drew her to him, from across the room and through all obstacles. It was the same look that was in Renzo’s eyes when he kissed her in the silent belly of the Polite Request.</p>
<p>When she reached him she was as breathless as if she had trekked across the Swath on her own two feet. She smiled up at him, hopeful, shy, self-conscious. He looked down at her, his smile slight and crooked. But his eyes, deep blue, like the sky at night, bore into her with their own fire. Soon she realized she had been dancing with him, and couldn’t remember how long they’d been pressed together.</p>
<p>“That machine,” he said. “What was it.” From between his clenched teeth it sounded like a command, rather than a question.</p>
<p>“It was just something I made,” she replied, lost in the blissful radiance of his desire for her.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t just anything. It was the greatest invention since liftstone.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a suit of armor. It’s powered by a magic generator on the back,” she explained, his manicured hands resting on her body coaxing the words from her. She would tell him everything, answer every question, as long as that gaze of lust remained on her.</p>
<p>“How does it work?”</p>
<p>It was such a broad question she faltered, not knowing where to begin. The intoxication of his look seemed to have addled her mind.</p>
<p>“It... listens to your body and moves the way your body does,” she added, blushing childishly at the thought of bodies moving. “The armor and the warding spells protect you from harm.”</p>
<p>“How did you make it? Are there plans for it?”</p>
<p>She paused before answering again. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. He was supposed to take her in his arms and lull her into his protection and dance the night away with her. Then they were supposed to flit off to a hidden corner in the ship and quietly learn each other’s bodies. They weren’t supposed to talk about these boring, unromantic things.</p>
<p>“I made it... slowly. It was hard to manufacture. There aren’t really plans of it. I just sort of cobbled it together,” she said, hoping to appease him. But his expression had faded.</p>
<p>No, it hadn’t faded, she realized. She was just finally seeing it for what it was. It was lust plain and true, but not lust for her, it was lust for her suit. It was a lust for power.</p>
<p>A lump rose in her throat. Abruptly, she was scared and unhappy and lonely all at the same time. The emotional swerve was almost too much for her to bear.</p>
<p>“What would I have to pay you to make plans and give them to me?”</p>
<p>Her heart broke. She couldn’t breathe for a long moment, as though her lungs were made of glass. Suddenly, she was weak and small and vulnerable. The light of his desire parched her like the summer sun.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, I’ll be stealing her from you for a dance or three,” Charlotte interjected, slipping between them and spinning Fleurette away from Lombard’s clutching, sweaty grasp. She followed along, head spinning, reeling in shock.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t talk about work at the ball, my pet.”</p>
<p>“Ahg,” Fleurette’s voice caught in her throat. She couldn’t speak about the frenzy of emotions she’d felt in the last half-hour. She merely clung to Charlotte, radiant in her elegant dress, and danced the night away with her instead.</p>
<p>Slowly, as she regained her faculties, she became aware of the danger. The faces around them were all-too-interested and over suspicious. She tried to focus on Charlotte’s heartbreaking face. The leering faces around her were whispering, buzzing with lies and defamation.</p>
<p>“Shh,” Charlotte whispered in her ear, her sweet breath tickling her neck. “Ignore them. Dance with me.”</p>
<p>So they danced anyway. Three waltzes, two foxtrots, and a tango passed as they stared into each other.</p>
<p>Cybeline had long since left, too distraught by her friend’s obvious immorality to watch any longer. Renzo had come and gone, like a king with a harem dogging his every move. The coven, whose spies had been moving through the crowd, coagulated to watch their handiwork unfold.</p>
<p>They danced and danced, and finally, blissfully, Fleurette’s worries and fears began to dissipate. She danced with Charlotte, gazing into her dark, violet eyes as Charlotte gazed back into her bright emeralds. But a dangerous word pricked their ears.</p>
<p>“...drawings...” they heard.</p>
<p>Sketches. Pictures. Someone had been in Fleurette’s room.</p>
<p>The two girls parted from the closed position and Charlotte led Fleurette out from the ballroom, sweeping proudly through the tittering crowd.</p>
<p>Behind them, the ugly hydra of rumors began to take hold of the crowd, at the beck and call of the Class Morality Council.Renzo sat in the pilot’s seat of the Polite Request. He leaned sideways, so that he could stare at the empty copilot seat. As usual, the ghost of his copilot, Eos, haunted him. He could almost see her, sitting there, shaking her head at him. She’d have been disappointed in him.</p>
<p>“You don’t know what it’s been like,” he said to the empty seat. The console lit up briefly as patrol orders from the Emperor’s Watchdog were broadcast. His eyes flicked to the panel of glass switches, colored dials, and blinking readouts. When he looked back, the ghost had gone.</p>
<p>Renzo shifted back into a more comfortable position.</p>
<p>“You’re gone anyway,” he said. “Why would you care.”</p>
<p>He lit another cigarette and took a brief swig from a flask that locked into the dash. A weary sigh issued from his lips along with a stream of smoke.</p>
<p>“She was so pretty in that dress,” he said to himself. His cigarette muffled his words, but no one was there to misunderstand him. “I wish I could have danced with her.”</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and called her ruby, golden image into his head. She was so delicate, so fragile. Everything about her made him want her.</p>
<p>Not even with Eos had he desired someone so physically. He couldn’t understand it. What was it about her that drove him to such madness? She’d defused his attempt to kill her with nothing but a kiss.</p>
<p>He shook his head again. Perhaps it was something wrong with him, rather than some facet of her.</p>
<p>At an impasse with his emotions, he ashed his cigarette and reclined his chair. He watched the smoke drift above him.</p>
<p>Someday, the council would call him in to have her done away with once and for all. He didn’t need to wonder if he’d be able to do it. He knew he couldn’t. The question on his mind was what would happen then. Would they cut their ties with him or would they send someone for him as well?</p>
<p>He chuckled. “I hope they send Lombard,” he said in the darkness. “I’d pay them to send Lombard.”</p>
<p>He stubbed out his cigarette and stared at the riveted plates of the cockpit ceiling. If he loved her any less, he could have taken her and flown to some far distant part of the world, far from the Fleet, far from Glorgox, far from the council.</p>
<p>He took another hit from his flask.</p>
<p>“I hope that little club tears itself apart.”Cybeline sat in the lunch room alone. The only unoccupied area had been at the end of a table crowded with chatting gossips. They ignored her completely when she sat down, leaning in to discuss the most recent rumors. Cybeline sat and stared at her food, trying to ignore everything.</p>
<p>“I heard that the countess is taking advantage of the embless,” one girl said to the others. “She’s using her as her personal plaything. You know how House ‘G’ has been with House ‘M’ lately. Maybe they even sold the embless to her to cover their debts.” The other girls giggled quietly as the next girl spoke up.</p>
<p>“Well I heard that their fathers put them up to it. You know, be all friendly with each other. I heard that they’re trying to seal a deal that’ll end that feud once and for all.</p>
<p>“No, it’s totally the disease.”</p>
<p>The other girls turned to look at the new speaker. “You haven’t heard about that? Look, why would the daughters of two rival houses ever be caught together? There’s a disease going around that causes your brain to go haywire. It drives you mad and confuses your emotions.” The other gossips stared at her. Cybeline clenched her jaw, unable to eat, unable to leave.</p>
<p>“It’s not as crazy as the one I heard the other day. A boy from medical told me that they’re actually monsters. They can take on the form of young women, but they can only mate with their own species. So the countess and the embless are trying to have little monster babies. Isn’t that gross?”</p>
<p>“Almost as gross as the real thing,” another girl said. They all nodded to each other over their lunches.Owing to the fact that everyone was avoiding her again, Fleurette was pleasantly ignorant of the rumors. Instead, she was struggling with the concept of anathema. The taboo of women having relationships was so firmly ingrained in her culturally developed mind that it was almost impossible for her to accept her feelings for Charlotte.</p>
<p>Fleurette sat at her desk as the other students returned from lunch. Pressed flat on the desk she had a letter. It was from her father. It invited her back to the Dragoon for a short party in celebration of their survival of another monster attack. She skimmed it over and over again, but it was clear that Charlotte wasn’t invited. She couldn’t fault him for that, but she didn’t want to leave her friend alone on the Lady of Blades. She wrote her father a quick note declining the invitation. When she looked up, Charlotte had returned and was looking back at her covertly. The other girls of the class were staring at them both, acutely aware of their connection and eager for more juicy suppositions. Fleurette shook her head minutely and focused on the blackboard until Miss Mathusus came in.Charlotte knocked quietly on the door to Fleurette’s room, trying not to alert anyone else in the dormitory about their secret meetings. She peeked over her shoulders to check for the spies of the coven and slipped out of the hall. Inside, Fleurette looked up from the intricate soldering work on her desk. Thick black goggles replaced her usual gold-rimmed glasses, but they were pushed up onto her forehead. She smiled a wide, beaming smile as Charlotte draped her cloak over the bedpost.</p>
<p>“You had me waiting, Lottie,” she said.</p>
<p>“It was hard to get away today,” she replied, scratching the back of her head. “What are you working on, there?”</p>
<p>“Come see!” Fleurette closed the case of a small object about the size of a hand and maneuvered the pair of them on the desk so Charlotte could see them as she walked over. The devices were rounded rectangles of brass and steel, each with a small grating of fine mesh, a couple of knobs, and a slender copper-wrapped antenna.</p>
<p>“You made a radio?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“What is it, then?”</p>
<p>“It’s two radios!” she exclaimed excitedly. “One for me and one for you. This way we can talk to each other whenever we want without all the sneaking around.”</p>
<p>“That would make things somewhat easier,” Charlotte said, clutching her face in mild exasperation. There had been several close calls. A memory of the time they got stuck in a classroom because of the cleaning staff stuck in her mind.</p>
<p>“And look, I’ve even found a channel that no one is using! I don’t think normal radios even get this frequency. Its perfect!”</p>
<p>“How does it work?”</p>
<p>“Easy. Here, take this,” Fleurette said, pressing one into Charlotte’s hands, “and I’ll go in the closet. You go sit in the chair and hold it like this. And tune these dials here to nine eight seven.” She scampered into the closet and buried herself in her clothes. She turned on her handset and whispered into it, “I like the way you kiss.”</p>
<p>The gasp outside the closet alerted her to her success.</p>
<p>“I’ve thought that you’re pretty since the moment our eyes met,” Charlotte whispered back.</p>
<p>Fleurette took a moment to overcome her embarrassment at the compliment. Then she exited the closet full of clothes beaming.</p>
<p>“It’s brilliant,” Charlotte told her. “I can hear you crystal clear. It’s like you’re right here. It’s even better than my father’s military radio.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful!” she said, clapping her hands together in glee. “And look, this little bit right here lets you pull a standard power plug from the back to charge it. But it works when it’s not plugged in, too, of course.”</p>
<p>“And it fits in a clutch purse,” agreed Charlotte.</p>
<p>“Just don’t let anyone catch you with it. You can actually listen to a lot of the secret channels outside the normal range band with it. Someone would confiscate it if they knew what it could do.”</p>
<p>“I’ll keep it safe, Hawa,” Charlotte said, giving her a hug. She settled back on the bed, placing the new radio safely in her bag and retrieving her music book. She looked up at Fleurette with an expectant smile. Fleurette went and retrieved her drawing supplies and sat on the bed across from Charlotte.</p>
<p>“So what do you want to use the radios for?” Charlotte asked innocently.</p>
<p>“Well, we can talk to each other whenever we want, you know? So maybe we can call each other when we have things to talk about,” came Fleurette’s awkward reply. “Like when we’re angry about something and want someone to talk to.”</p>
<p>“Can I call you when I have a new song?”</p>
<p>“Sure! It’d be like having my own music station!”</p>
<p>Charlotte pondered a thought and went back to jotting lyrics for a while.</p>
<p>“Can I call you when I have a bad day?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. I’ll do my best to cheer you up,” Fleurette said casually, sketching Charlotte’s graceful neck.</p>
<p>“Can I call you when I’m, you know, lonely?”</p>
<p>Fleurette’s eyes blinked a couple of times while she processed Charlotte’s words and expression. She blushed deeply and bit her lip, nodding nervously.Fleurette waved Charlotte into the glinting light of the workshop.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Master Ilorgan’s not in the shop tonight. Even if he was, he would never speak poorly of us. Come on. I want to show you some of the other things I’ve made.”</p>
<p>She led Charlotte between heaps of cuttings and canisters of extra capacitance gel. They weaved their way back to the big workbench with a wide diagram of a spellgun hanging over it.</p>
<p>“That’s the Assassin. Master Ilorgan named it for me. I designed it so that infantry could kill pickers with impunity from a long way off.”</p>
<p>“Is that drawing real size?”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>“It’s huge. Wouldn’t it be too cumbersome?”</p>
<p>“He can, but its not really good for up-close combat. That’s what this bad boy is for,” she said unrolling a similar drawing of the stocky disperser.</p>
<p>“Wow. It looks totally different. What’s this one do?”</p>
<p>“It fires a spread. It transforms the magic into a cone so that it hits a lot of targets. See these? It uses three cartridges per shot.”</p>
<p>“That sounds pretty expensive.”</p>
<p>“Not really, standard spell cartridges are produced by the hundreds by the mindwork divisions. Standard infantry usually carry thirty to seventy depending on the situation.”</p>
<p>By the time she’d explained the rest of the weapons, Fleurette had almost managed to muster her courage. She took Charlotte to a small corner of the workshop. She removed a petite case marked with the universal symbol for “do not open” and set it on the scarred desk surface. She opened the case and removed a couple sheets of soft, clean velvet.</p>
<p>“Don’t want them to get dirty,” she said by way of explanation. She then extracted several long, slender devices from the case and set them on the velvet one by one. Each had a unique, organic shape despite being made of highly polished brass. One featured tiny spell runes all over its surface and seemed to have a spell cartridge slot. Another was subtly covered in tiny ridges. The last one appeared to be sculpted in the likeness of a tentacle, featuring ridges of small bumps down its undulating length.[too much detail?]</p>
<p>Charlotte was bright red. The intended use of the devices was as obvious as it was embarrassing. On the other hand, the audacity to create something that satisfied a woman’s needs was amazing. She glanced at Fleurette, trying to gauge her expectations. Should she be excited? Seduced? Embarrassed? They were both at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“Go ahead and pick one,” Fleurette urged.</p>
<p>Charlotte drew a deep breath and returned her attention to the devices. The one with the bumps seemed a little too exciting. Of the other two, the one with the spell runes seemed the most interesting.</p>
<p>“What... happens when you load that thing?” She asked, pointing at the cylinder in question.</p>
<p>“It vibrates. It’s adjustable too.” She turned it around, displaying a dial on the end that the cartridge passes through to get loaded. “The higher the dial, the more intense, but the shorter it’ll last. I have a bunch of extra cartridges if you want to try that one.”</p>
<p>Charlotte nodded and Fleurette wrapped up a discrete bag and case for her new implement.</p>
<p>“Which one do you use?” Charlotte asked, blushing even deeper.</p>
<p>“I like them all, but when those girls came into my room they took my favorite one. Right now my favorite is yours.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry, I don’t have to take this one,” she stammered, but Fleurette interrupted by pressing a tiny, slender finger to her lips.</p>
<p>“I want you to try it,” she said, fidgeting.</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p>“We can talk on the radio, t-too,” Fleurette stuttered as they prepare to return to their rooms.</p>
<p>“I’d like that.”Charlotte lead the way out of the Finishing Academy and through corridors that Fleurette had never explored. They moved quietly, secretly, as though the region of the ship they were in was off limits.</p>
<p>Charlotte took Fleurette’s hand as they came to a door marked with a green plant symbol. She unlatched several levers and opened the door, which blew open with the sudden change in pressure. Charlotte pulled Fleurette through and out into the sunlight. She hauled the door closed after them.</p>
<p>It was a garden, Fleurette saw, a wing of hull armor that swung out from a slot in the side of the ship to provide the plants with water and light. It was beautiful. The low planters were packed tightly and dew from the clouds glistened on the foliage. The colorful blossoms of several of her favorite foods peered up at the sun, shaking in the wind. Charlotte led her across the back edge of the garden. The air whipped past them, wreaking havoc with their hair.</p>
<p>After a moment, they were tucked into the least windy corner, which also happened to be the least visible corner from any other part of the ship. It was an excellent hiding spot, visible from only one window and with the cover of plants and planters, it was the best place for Charlotte to show Fleurette her own secret.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry we didn’t get to talk last night. My father was very angry when I got back. He had been trying to contact me through the dorm supervisor all night, apparently.”</p>
<p>“At least the dorm supervisor didn’t think to check my room. I think that means the rumors still haven’t pervaded the entire ship.”</p>
<p>“Want to try tonight?” Charlotte asked, fidgeting in an unusually girlish way.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Fleurette said breezily, trying not to think about the blood rushing to her face. “So what did you call me out to this dangerous platform for? A sketch?” she asked, phrasing the question with a wicked grin.</p>
<p>The blade sang.</p>
<p>Charlotte swung it in a flourish, causing it swish and ring in the air. Fleurette scrambled upright in panic for a moment.</p>
<p>“I wanted to show you my hidden talent too.”</p>
<p>“It’s not assassination, is it?” Fleurette gulped.</p>
<p>Charlotte laughed her lovely, melodic laugh. “Of course not. It is a secret though. Have a seat. I have a little demonstration for this.”</p>
<p>Fleurette’s pounding heart eventually allowed her to slide back down the wall and into a sitting slump. Charlotte walked to the middle of the platform and took a poised stance, the sword in the scabbard at her hip.</p>
<p>Spontaneously, she lashed out with the flexible sword, slashing a wide arc through the air before her and parrying an imaginary stroke from behind. She thrust backwards, pivoting to face that way at the same time. She parried and stabbed, occasionally striking with a kick or a palm to disrupt the attacks of the invisible combatants. The swordplay dance went on for a solid thirty minutes. Fleurette was mesmerized, Charlotte’s movements were at once both graceful and brutal.</p>
<p>At the end of the presentation, Charlotte stalked calmly back from the center of the platform like a predatory cat. Her thick, dark, wavy hair trailed in the wind behind her. Fleurette could barely speak, stumbling over herself to relate how amazing the display was and how beautiful she was performing it.</p>
<p>“It’s actually a practice for combat. Each move covers a certain area and performing one of the practices builds your skill so that you react instinctively to real combat situations. It’s something my father insisted I learn in secret.”</p>
<p>“I can see why. I imagine you’d take a lot less guff from the underclassmen if they knew you could do that.”</p>
<p>“I’d also probably get expelled.”</p>
<p>“There’s always duels,” Fleurette suggested.</p>
<p>“Don’t tempt me,” Charlotte replied.Their rooms were dark. Fleurette’s was lit by tiny lights on her desk powered by magic. Charlotte’s was lit by candles on her nightstand. The devices lay on their beds as they both eagerly prepared.</p>
<p>Fleurette had propped up several of her best portraits of Charlotte next to her bed. She had turned off the overhead light already, but the light from her desk lamp was still too much. She turned it down to the lower setting. She took a small vial of Charlotte’s favorite perfume and dabbed a bit of its scent onto her thin shirt, enjoying how it evoked Charlotte’s presence.</p>
<p>Fleurette didn’t draw self portraits, so Charlotte had acquired a framed illusograph from Fleurette’s last birthday party. She had turned off all her lights except a small glowing crystal to light the illusograph. Fleurette’s brilliant smile reflected back at her in the dim light. She had borrowed one of Fleurette’s shirts, preferring her natural scent mixed with the slight fragrance of flowers she wore.</p>
<p>Despite their already quite adventurous plans, there was a long, awkward pause once they were ready. They fiddled with the radios, making sure no one would hear them.</p>
<p>“Well, I checked again. This band is too specific for anyone to pick us up. It’s right between the range bands of the military and civilian frequencies, so no one’s going to accidentally stumble on us. We should be fine.”</p>
<p>“I’m ready on my end,” Charlotte said.</p>
<p>“It’s embarrassing isn’t it?” Fleurette asked.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I don’t think I could do this without the radio. I’d be petrified.”</p>
<p>There was a painfully long pause. Fleurette fantasized Charlotte beside her, cuddled up next to her. In her mind she could feel the warm sensation of Charlotte’s hip touching her thigh. Fleurette bit her lip, imagining all the things they would do together.</p>
<p>Charlotte’s breathing came in over the radio, quiet as a butterfly. Fleurette’s was overwhelmed with waking dreams of Charlotte’s manipulations. She gasped herself, aroused before they’d even begun.</p>
<p>Fleurette’s heart shot out of her chest at the sound of the door. The knob rattled as the night-duty student made the rounds. Fleurette pressed herself into the bed, as though she could melt away and never be seen again. Once the sound of the evening watch passed down the hall, Fleurette turned her radio down so low that she had to hold it to her ear to hear Charlotte.</p>
<p>“Charlotte, stop, the night-duty is coming around! Stop! They might hear you!” she hissed into her radio, but it didn’t sound like she had been heard. A held breath later, a knock sounded at Charlotte’s door, a wing away from Fleurette’s. Charlotte squeaked quietly, but from there, Fleurette lost the thread of events occurring in the distant room.</p>
<p>After a quiet tussle with her bed, Charlotte came back. “I gotta go,” she hissed. Fleurette heard the distinct pop of the radio turning off and collapsed back into her covers, feeling exactly as naked as she was.Fleurette was in her seat early the next morning, waiting for Charlotte. She fiddled with her books and papers anxiously, hoping nothing had happened to her the night before. She stacked her things neatly again and stood. She left the classroom and stood next to the door, casting impatient looks down the hallways. When Charlotte eventually appeared, she hurried over to her.</p>
<p>“Everything okay?” she asked in an oblique whisper.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Nothing happened. Asked if I was well then left. Didn’t even come in.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Fleurette breathed. “What a relief.”</p>
<p>As they entered the classroom, the stares of the other students separated them like a knife. They went to their desks and sat, glancing at each other for the rest of the morning.</p>
<p>When lunch came, Cybeline left without them. Charlotte hung her head in sadness. Fleurette stood and called Cybeline’s name, but she hurried out of the room.</p>
<p>“Come on,” Charlotte said, gesturing for Fleurette to follow her. “Today probably isn’t a good day to visit the cafeteria.”</p>
<p>The pair of them walked quietly to their favorite sandwich shop. They ordered and sat at a small table hidden in a nook of the building.</p>
<p>The server came around with their lunches and they tucked in, savoring the rare treat of a lunch off the school grounds. They barely glanced up at each other, shyly avoiding eye contact. Blushing smiles and coy smirks acted as side dishes for their sandwiches.</p>
<p>Once they were done with their meals, they hurried back to the school. They were already attracting enough attention, and being late wouldn’t do them any favors. They slipped in before the teacher, when the room was still only half full. They collapsed into their seats and pretended that nothing had happened.Fleurette found herself daydreaming later that afternoon, sketching in a bright study lounge, when, of all things, a familiar scent caught her attention. She couldn’t place it immediately, but it was someone she knew. She could tell it wasn’t Charlotte, so she didn’t get up to look right away. It wasn’t a female scent at all she realized. It was spicy, sharp, leathery, with overtones of machine oil. She slid out from behind a structural spar and looked towards the passage through the center of the lounge to find Captain Salazar casually wandering down the hall.</p>
<p>A number of girls watched him as he passed. One even gathered up her courage, apparently prepared for Captain Salazar to show up at any moment, and chased him down with a sickly pink love letter. He blanched, trying not to destroy her feelings, and mumbled something she didn’t hear. He placed the letter in his pocket and asked her another question. In response, she pushed him in the chest and ran away crying her eyes out. He scratched his head and looked around. His eyes passed over Fleurette and she ducked back behind the spar.</p>
<p>“Ah hah!” he exclaimed, and she heard him walk towards her. Silently she cursed herself for being curious. She wasn’t sure she could take any more romance at the moment. She felt fragile and vulnerable, afraid that she might do something she’d regret later.</p>
<p>As he reached the pylon, she stuffed her drawings back into her bag and ripped open a book, trying to settle as casually into a reading pose as possible.</p>
<p>“Why do you look so spooked?” he asked, simply walking around the carefully constructed barriers of the desk and the lounge seating. The Lady of Blades was full of such private little cubbyholes for students. He looked tired of searching.</p>
<p>“Do I look spooked?” She asked, her eyes flicking back and forth, trying to find a graceful way to escape his impending company.</p>
<p>“You look terrified. Are you alright? Did I do something wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, its just...”</p>
<p>“Ah... what happened... earlier.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“For that I am sorry. You have my word that I will never again take any mission remotely similar to that. I will never do anything to hurt you.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful,” she said shiftily.</p>
<p>“So much for putting you at ease. Will you talk to me? What’s wrong?” He took a seat near by, but not close enough to bother her anymore than she already was.</p>
<p>She sighed. She looked at him, trying to figure out what to do. He had arranged himself in his chair, his strong limbs crossed lazily. He exuded strength and power and authority without even trying. It was no wonder the other girls threw themselves at his feet.</p>
<p>“Did I just see you get a love letter?” she asked to distract him from her discomfort.</p>
<p>“You did.” He didn’t look very happy. “But that’s got nothing to do with this. I’m not here for love letters.”</p>
<p>“Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Well, there’s two reasons,” Renzo said. “First, I wanted to apologize to you about what happened on the ground.”</p>
<p>“Apology accepted, Captain,” she said stiffly.</p>
<p>“About both things that happened on the ground,” he said, not buying that she had already forgiven him for all that he had done.</p>
<p>“I accepted it already. I can’t rescind my acceptance unless you rescind your apology.”</p>
<p>“You’re really uncomfortable around me now, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Why is that? I thought you had accepted my apology?”</p>
<p>“What was the second thing?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I just wanted to talk with you.”</p>
<p>She stared.</p>
<p>“I thought that you showed a lot of... fortitude in that whole operation. I was hoping to get to know you better.”</p>
<p>“Are... you courting me?” she said in an incredulous hiss.</p>
<p>He sighed, exasperated. “Yes. I, Renzo Salazar, find you to be a fascinating creature, and I would like to ask your permission to begin courting you. Is that plain enough?” he asked, rubbing the bridge of his shapely nose. A forelock of his dark hair had fallen from his loose ponytail a bit and it took all Fleurette’s willpower not to get up and help him fix it while pressing herself against his powerful, charming body.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she all but whispered.</p>
<p>She blushed. Utterly conflicted at this point, she was lost in his charm. Charlotte had pushed Lombard from her mind, and now Renzo was now fighting for her attention as well. She wasn’t sure what to think about her first suitor, who seemed to care more about her servosuit than her. She was equally unsure what to think about courting a handsome, strong, and wealthy captain with his own ship. It could be a very ambitious relationship. With her own ship, she could even start running her own courier missions to deliver Mecanwaithe technology to the Fleet. But both of these relationships were at least plausible. Her feelings towards Charlotte were a total impasse, as impossible as they were important.</p>
<p>Renzo moved closer, blotting out her thoughts like a hunter assessing his prey. His presence enfolded her, capturing her spirit. She wanted to be taken away by him. She wanted to struggle against him, to have him force her. She wanted him to want her. Though there were only a few other students in the lounge, she could feel the disappointed stares of Lombard and Charlotte boring into her back. Her interest in Renzo was agonizing.</p>
<p>“So, I guess you don’t really care about that letter,” she said, trying to buy some time to breathe and think.</p>
<p>In response he took it out and shredded it carefully and quietly, then replaced the confetti back in the pocket of his well-maintained uniform. He looked back at her, locking her with his piercing gray eyes. He pinned her to her seat with his stare. She felt him taking her over. She felt his gaze wandered over her, studying her, looking for weakness and strength. His predatory eyes aroused a tingle in her hips and thighs as he licked his lips ever-so-slightly.</p>
<p>He sat down next to her, years later. The motion itself seemed to take months. She sat, immobile as a gargoyle, next to him. Rather than stretching a long arm around behind her to cradle her, as she expected, he leaned forward and steepled his fingers under his lip. His eyebrows drew together in thought. She watched him, attentive to the slightest motions of his expressive face and hands.</p>
<p>“I was a pirate,” he began.</p>
<p>She sat in awed silence, she’d never met anyone who had defied the Fleet and lived to tell about it. She waited for him to continue, willing him not to stop there.</p>
<p>“This was before the War. The ship used to be called the Hunter. I got her by capturing her from officers who were scuttling her to escape from monsters. I brought her down and fixed her up at Blackshard Mountain. I got a crew and started raiding the scouting parties that left the fleet to look for resources. We had a... a mage. She helped keep us safe by obscuring us in clouds and turning us into shadow at night.</p>
<p>“I was young and stupid and naive. I didn’t realize how far I’d fallen until I killed a young sailor with my bare hands. He wasn’t much older than you. Neither was I. I killed him so he wouldn’t kill —her.” He choked on the girl’s name for a moment, unable to speak it aloud.</p>
<p>“After that, the Ground War started and they offered me a huge sum of money and a clean slate if I signed on with them. I signed with your father, you know. My loyalty has always lay with House Mecanwaithe, regardless of who my allegiance is sold to.</p>
<p>“But even after years of pirating, I had no idea what what I was getting into. The Ground War was horrible beyond anything I could have imagined. I consider myself a survivor by trade, so I tried to take solace in the money I was paid. But coins make a poor pillow, as they say.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know,” Fleurette said, cursing herself for not being able to offer more compassionate words.</p>
<p>“Nobody does. They’re all dead, except your father and the Captain. You’ll notice that people are pretty glib about the era before the Ground War.</p>
<p>“Eventually, I just stopped caring, I think. For years I never thought about anything, I just moved like an automaton. I just did what Ra-Nydor wanted.</p>
<p>“But when I saw you down there, the way you fought, how free you were, I realized how... shallow my life had been. Living for myself. Caring for no one and nothing.”</p>
<p>He was standing over her now, his hands against the wall as if he could push it over to prove himself to her.</p>
<p>“That’s why I want to be with you. I want to follow you now. I want to be with you because for the first time, I care about something that matters.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you want to dance with me at the ball?” she asked, somehow between him in the wall, trapped between his arms. Only a few columns and a smattering of potted plants obscured the intimate gesture from the other students. It didn’t seem to matter that they might be watching.</p>
<p>“I... I couldn’t figure out if I wanted to apologize or try to seduce you.”</p>
<p>“So you decided to do both?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Is it working?”</p>
<p>“I already accepted your apology.”</p>
<p>“What about the other part?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure...” she lied, leaning towards him, eyes closed to his dark power over her.Renzo leaned down, capturing her shoulder and pressing her into the crevice of a metal column. Fleurette’s thick curls escaped around her like a halo. She turned her conflicted face from his as he breathed in the scent of her neck. His hot lips and bristly chin brushed against the line of her jaw. He was gnashing his teeth in some kind of internal conflict, but she couldn’t bear to look at him. She was afraid that if she did, she might fall for him completely.</p>
<p>“I wish I were a better man,” Renzo said, aching to bite her delicate skin. “I wish I were strong enough to hold my desire at bay.”</p>
<p>Fleurette, still delightfully petrified, could only try to control her breathing. Renzo’s rough thumb gently hooked the top of her clothes and pulled the strap of her bodice down over her shoulder. Her breath caught in her throat and her eyes fluttered, as though trying to block out the sensation.</p>
<p>“Why am I so scared?” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Shh,” Renzo answered. The logical part of his mind surfaced briefly and he glanced around at the other girls in the study lounge. The obstructions had done their job so far, they were still unnoticed.</p>
<p>Renzo pulled Fleurette close. She gasped quietly, struggling with and against him. He lowered her to a kneeling position on the floor, where the sofas and desks scattered around the room provided them with more cover from the waiting eyes of the other students. Renzo cradled her in his unyielding arms, pulling her close. She couldn’t stop her hand from placing itself against his firm chest. Her chin seemed to lift of its own accord, and her lips parted for him at his command, not hers. He bent and kissed her with slow, unrestrained force. She was completely within his grasp.</p>
<p>Renzo shifted around her and placed his huge, powerful hands on her waist. Every shard of her splintered mind screamed for her to stop, but her body couldn’t hear. He stroked her thigh and her belly as she clung to him, intoxicated by his touch.</p>
<p>Stupid body, she thought savagely, stop this instant!</p>
<p>Still she pressed against him, panting and trying to guide his hands between her thighs. The chime rang for dinner like a bucket of ice water. Fleurette squeaked in instant terror, scrambling backward away from Renzo, who jerked into alertness as though he were under attack. His eyes flicked back and forth across the room as the girls collected their things. Several groups would have to pass by them to leave the lounge.</p>
<p>Renzo skulked quickly out of the seating area and stood up behind a steel support beam, straightening his clothes and trying to rearrange his trousers. Fleurette’s mind raced and she snatched a drawing pad from her bag as she pushed her straps back up her shoulders. She pretended to be sketching on the floor as the clusters of students sauntered past.</p>
<p>After a few minutes had passed, Fleurette picked herself up off the floor and fixed her hair. She placed her items back in her bag as though one false move would shatter her trembling body. Renzo ambled back over with his hands jammed into his pockets.</p>
<p>“We almost just died, didn’t we?” She asked, trying to make herself presentable enough to escape to her room. She felt much more disheveled than she looked.</p>
<p>“In that we almost got caught? Yes. They’d have turned us in and we’d have been exiled for sure,” he replied, rolling his eyes ironically. “I think at worst, we would have become the talk of the ship.”</p>
<p>Sitting on one of the couches for stability, Fleurette fixed her hair and cleaned smudges from her glasses. A few moments later, she spoke again. “Renzo... I don’t know what will happen. My relationships are so confusing right now. I don’t know if you and I…”</p>
<p>He turned to her, suddenly sympathetic. “Hey, shh. It’s okay. It’s just courting, remember? Girls court several boys at once all the time, right?”</p>
<p>She broke eye contact and looked away, blushing.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s true,” she said.</p>
<p>“...Mecanwaithe? Miss Mecanwaithe?”</p>
<p>Fleurette jolted upright in class the next day, suddenly ripped from her furious drawing and inventing on her desk to read a few simple lines from a literature text for class. She zipped through them, barely paying attention.</p>
<p>The class stared at her, astounded at how easily she read the ancient text and translated it. She sat back down and dove straight back into scribbling her notes. She needed to keep her pace up to keep the thought of Renzo from her mind. Even a brief interruption was enough to let the guilt surface again. She tried to recapture her rhythm.</p>
<p>She was deep into an entirely new method for distributing power from a magic generator. She drew diagrams of micro power storage units around each major power draw, the servos around the knees, hips, shoulders, elbows and back. Like the new system she’d devised for the Dragoon, the new suit power system would act like a well managed company. Each area was controlled by a small capacitor and each capacitor drew power from another, one level higher. The hierarchy made the entire suit more efficient.</p>
<p>As soon as she was done with the power system, she started detailing out an idea for a new type of magical armor. She designed a system of embedded micro wards in a layered stratum on the interior of the armor plates. She scratched complex metaphysical notes on the page, teasing out variables. Her arithmetic indicated that hundreds of small wards should provide more stable coverage with smaller vulnerabilities and lower overall power usage. The trick was to design the power feed so that the armor wouldn’t collapse completely as soon as a single ward was broken. Elaborate design drawings and careful pattern studies filled pages and pages of her notebook.</p>
<p>A small crumple of paper suddenly landed on her desk, rolling over her drawings and distracting her. She picked it up, glancing around the class to find the source of the note, but everyone was studiously paying attention to some boring lecture about the economy of magic power in the Grand Imperial Fleet. Fleurette opened the note.</p>
<p>“Where were you yesterday? I got out of my lessons early and I looked for you but I couldn’t find you anywhere.” It was obviously from Charlotte, even though she hadn’t signed it. No one else had such perfect, nearly mechanically precise handwriting. Fleurette wondered if it had to do with her upbringing.</p>
<p>“I need to talk to you after school. In private,” she wrote back. She folded her note up and waited for the teacher to write something on the blackboard to toss the note into Charlotte’s lap. She read it and nodded her head, still looking forward, acting the good student.</p>
<p>Part of the way through their last class, one of the servants of House Glorgox entered the class without apology and walked directly to Charlotte’s desk, offending the students almost as much as the teacher.</p>
<p>The man beckoned Charlotte to come with him. He leaned over and spoke behind his hand, so that no one could catch what he said. Charlotte’s eyes flashed back to Fleurette apologetically. She mouthed, “later,” as her minder dragged her out into the hallway.</p>
<p>Fleurette spent the rest of the day trying to hold in her frustration over the situation. She admitted she felt like she had wronged her best friend.
